CMI is recursively invoked twice.
The anonymous CMI is blocking forever.
The function CMI lock the locked container again.
CMI should not cause deadlock.
The CMI acquires lock_1 and gets stuck.
I experience deadlocks at the point the CMI is processed and emptied.
The CMI was not released in a for loop and acquired again in the next loop iteration.
The blocking may also lead to deadlocking the EventLoop in cases where a CMI is used.
