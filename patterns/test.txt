There is a rare possibility of race-condition during channel re-connection and RTopic subscription invoked first time.
There is no timeout when waiting for the lock.
Is there a possibility that other threads will have concurrent problems because the thread has been unlocked before the transaction has been submitted?
when many different threads are asking for the same lock key the client is stuck and no thread acquires the lock.
This result is Thread dump.
there is a problem in high concurrency.
