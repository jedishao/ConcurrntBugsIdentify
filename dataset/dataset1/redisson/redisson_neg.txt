Promises vs Futures?Hi there!As I understand, Future returned by RedisAsyncConnection moves API user back to the blocking world. Java futures are NOT non-blocking by nature, they have blocking get(). Thus API user needs to spawn new threads and say hello to threading overhead again. Then why Netty is used?I propose to return promises (Java's 8 CompletableFuture, Guava's ListenableFuture or jdeferred's promises).Thanks,Denis.

Setting expiry.Hi.I could not find a way to set expiry for the contents of the cache from within Java. Is this true, or did I miss something?Thank you.Jozsef.
WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN Error.I just imported redisson 1.0.3 via maven, set up a redis-server on localhost on default port and wanted to try the redisson redis client. My test code looks as following:But I'm getting an Error:java.lang.NoSuchFieldError:Am I doing something wrong or is this a dependency problem?
this "synchronized " protect what?in RedisClient.java.this "synchronized " protect what?
load balancer does not work as expected.I have test code for the load balance, but only the first instance got the load:Do I miss any thing?
Provide access to the underlying connection manager.It would be nice if the Redisson class exposed its connection manager.  The use case is to access low level redis commands using the same pool of connections as the high-level redisson abstractions.  Currently its protected and private which means I have to resort to ugly hacks to get to it.
Eval method does not work in RedisAsyncConnection.The eval method does not seem to work for me.  I traced the cause to this line in theRedisAsyncConnection:eval() method:It should instead be:In its current form, the script is escaped with double quotes and cannot be interpreted by redis.
Add Kryo Encoder.See GIST: https.
URGENT: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN.I do not have Jackson and do not want to use it. Sadly, the Config class has a hard pointer on it:Thus when creating a new Config instance I have the exception:Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError:Codecs should be made optional or at least the default should be the Serializer codec which only depends on the JDK, or a simple String <=> String codec.For now I cannot use Redisson properly :-(.
Publish message method should be moved out from RTopic.Pub a message doesn't require a pubsub connection, however get a RTopic does. There are many cases just want to publish a message, get a RTopic from Redisson will automatically subscribe on the channel, which is unnecessary and there is no safe way to close topic after publish message since there may be some listeners are actually interested in the topic.BTW, RedisConnection has a method  publish(K channel, V message)Unfortunelty the underlying connection manager is not exposed, see 13.Provide access to the underlying connection manager.
Support for HLL · 18.It would be really nice if you can add support for PFADD | PFCOUNT | PFMERGE commands in Redisson.
Android Support.Hi,I want to use this inside Android, is it supported?Thanks.
Question: Why do you have imported lettuce code into your project?Hi,why do you have imported lettuce code into your project instead of referencing it via artifact?The approach your library works is quite cool providing collections. It's just somehow annoying having no access to the underlying RedisClient. Redisson.create(RedisClient client) or even redisson.getList(RedisClient client, String name) etc. would be a way opener approach. The current way, it's Redisson who manages all the Redis stuff for you. I see Redisson as a sort of valueable add-on.
ConnectionWatchdog not works as expected.Hi Nikita, when I ran some load test, ConnectionWatchdog did not restore PubsubConnection correctly (my env is redis 2.8.3, java 1.7.0_45,Netty 4.0.19 final, OSX 10.9.2). After some digging, I found a couple of problems,When ChannelInitilizor ChannelInitializer.initChannel is called,           pipeLine.get(CommandHandler.class) and pipeLine.get(RedisAsyncConnection.class) return null, I guess the old ChannelPipeline had been destroyed.The connection retry and backoff doesn’t seem right, the connection attempt seems only fired when the channel is inactive, if re-connect did not work, no further attempt will be fired.RedissonTopic.promise.get().setSuccess(true) will throw IllegalStateException: complete already when PubsubConnection is re established.4)Though this is not a bug, it seems unnecessary to use a dedicated HashedTimeWheel to schedule reconnection task.I will push a patch later.
Make ConnectionManager accessible from Redisson.Hi,When we create a Redisson object, I would also need to execute some Redis commands.What is the best way ? Do I need to create another ConnectionManager completely separate from the one in the Redisson class, or it would be better to access the one created on the Redisson object, so that we can re-use it ?Thanks!
Support For Master Detection?Does reddison support the ability to add both a master and slave addresses and only write to the master?
Thread-safety questions - access to Thread-safe connection.In RBucket we have:get connection.do something.return back to pool.Before using this, I was simply getting a RedisConnection from the connection manager like this:The RedisConnection class javadoc states that the connection is thread-safe. So I was keeping a singleton reference over one connection to issue some simple commands like get, set, del, ... from several threads.Questions:Is a RedisConnection class is intended to be used this way (multiple threads doing get/set/del ops) ?If yes, would it be possible to expose this behavior so that users could get from Redisson a connection (with auto-reconnect) ? This connection could be kept as a singleton ref during the entire lifetime of the server and not be returned back to the pool, because this connection will be used often (i.e. session management). This will avoid the burden of the get from pool / return to pool code.Thanks!
Question: Does redisson handle redis clusters?Redisson clusters may return a 'MOVED' if a key is on another shard, does redisson handle that?
Sorted set scores collapsed to zeros.After running for a week or two, the scores collapsed to zeros or nead zero (10^-300) and we encountered an infinite loop in redisson when adding (it couldnt settle on a score). So we will manage the score ourselves.
Auth Issue Only On Read.I just added requirepass and masterauth to my configuration for 3 slaves and a master. Using 1.5 I am able to write just fine, but when I tried Map::get I get a RedisException: "NOAUTH Authentication required.".I've tried just using a single connection to the master, a 'useMasterSlaveConnection' with only 'setMasterAddress', and a 'useMasterSlaveConnection' with all hosts configured.When I connect with a tool like Redis Desktop Manager I am able to view the updated values just fine.

Several question about Redisson/Jedis.Note: I don't really know if there is a better place to ask for these sorts of questions... ;-)Besides all the cool features added to Redisson to use locks, queues, maps, etc... How does Redisson performs compared to Jedis in terms of:memory usage.speed.number of concurrent connections supported.use in multi-threading app requiring in both case using a pool.thread-safety.etc...For having used both, I strongly prefer the api of Redisson (using publish subscribe in a reliable way with Jedis is a pain, and also there is no codec). But I am wondering, since their implementation only rely on simple sockets and a pool, how it compares to Redisson, which is based on Netty.Also concerning thread-safety, having already aked a question about it, and in both libraries a connection pool is used for each operation and it is better to do so. So does thread-safety on a connection level really used ?Thanks!

RedissonList.RedissonList.subList() doesn't conform to the specifications of java.util.List, which states that subList() returns a view backed by the current list.On a related note, it would be nice to also have access to some of the buffered collections in addition to the redisson wrapper collections. If you're expecting to read all or most of a list, it would be wasteful to have to call RedissonList.get() for each element, resulting in another redis query each time. (Currently you can get a buffered list by calling subList(), but that's a workaround unique to the list collection, and it shouldn't really work that way - as mentioned above.)
Why RTopic.removeListener unsubscribes underlying PubSub channel.I ran into an issue in which I found if I remove a listener from an RTopic, it will unsubscribe the entire channel, which will kill the connection for all listeners and RTopic subscribed to the same channel. Following is the code in question.I am not quite sure whether I am using Redisson RTopic in the right way. Would you please help me to understand what’s the reason to unsubscribe the channel when removing one listener? And if I need to have multiple listeners subscribed on the same channel and the list of listeners will change dynamically (since it’s used on the application server to propagate changes to clients), what’s the right way to use RTopic?Your help will be greatly appreciated.
Netty NPE.Hey folks, I'm seeing this error on redisson 1.1.5 and it seems completely sporadic.
Failover in Redisson with Redis Cluster.I have created a cluster with 3 master and 3 slave.port 7000 seems to be myself,master.If 7000 goes down I get a connection refused exception with Redisson. Ideally it should shift to its slave.I am copying the exception here.Is it a known issue?
Key exists.Is there a way to distinguish between empty and non-existent collections? (Or some way to invoke the EXISTS command?)
RedissonList concurrency problem.How is it ever safe to rely on RedissonList.size() when each invocation can technically return a different value? This would mean that calling subList(0, size()), or even two consecutive calls to hasNext() on the iterator (which is normally what happens) can potentially cause an exception.
"Connection Leak" in RedissonBucket.Hi guys!When I get some error, eg: redis servers down, in getAsync and setAsync the connection is not released, once the release is done in a Promise listener, that never executes, can you check this please?Regards,Marcio.
Keys adding quotes when going to data store.I was working with redisson adding data to the data store.  I was having issues, so I went to the command line to check what was in the data store and couldn't find my structures (although the program seemed to find them OK).  So I listed the keys and got this:then from the cli, I entered "set foo bar" and listed the keys again and got this:it seems that redisson is surrounding the key names with quotes before storing them.

StackOverflowError.Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.StackOverflowError.
Lua Script Evaluation Support.Hey, I was wondering if there is any way to execute a LUA script in redisson. I can do it through the connection manager, using something like this:But obviously that's not the cleanest solution. Would it be possible to add a public evalScript() method, or something of the sort to the Redisson class? Thanks!

Add wildcard pubsub support (psubscribe/punsubscribe)The RedisPubSubConnection class already had a psubscribe and punsubscribe methods for dispatching commands to Redis, but they are not hooked up to anything.The RTopic interface should get a new addPListener and removePListener and all the underlying changes necessary to propagate down to RedisPubSubConnection.

Topic subscription: not re-subscribing after slave down or master change.Hi,Redis: 2.8.14.Redisson: 1.1.5.Environment: 1 master & 2 slaves on separate hosts (each running Redis & Redis Sentinel)Redisson connection: SentinelServersConfig (with 3 sentinels configured)We subscribe to a number of topics from all our clients talking to Redis via SentinelServersConfig. If there is a Redis failover/down event, the topics aren't properly re-subscribed to and messaging stops. Unsubscription is called, but re-subcription isn't.For a:slave down (re-subscription never works)sentinel initiated failover (re-subscription eventually always fails, but could work once or twice)
How do I register a Module on the Jackson ObjectMapper instance Redisson is using under the covers so it can handle Java8 time types?We are using Java8 java.time.Instant as the type in our objects, and running into this problem:com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: No suitable constructor found for type [simple type, class java.time.Instant]: can not instantiate from JSON object (need to add/enable type information?)And according to the Jaxson question I asked here: FasterXML/jackson-docs#3 I need to register a Module on the ObjectMapper instance that Redisson is using. How do I do that?

Infinite loop on connection failure.I'm using Redisson in Master/Slave configuration, and I'm running into an endless loop when using a bad address. BaseLoadBalancer.nextConnection() get called, catches the RedisConnectionException, then loops until clientsCopy is empty, then enters nextConnection() again, resulting in an infinite recursive loop.

How to config read data from slave servers?No description provided.
Config a specific slave for read operation.Assume that I have 3 zones z1, z2, and z3. Also I setup master node at z1, slave node 01 at z2, and slave node 02 at z3. I want to config like this:Read operation from z1 is redirected to master node.Read operation  from z2 is redirected to slave node 01.Read operation  from z3 is redirected to slave node 02.I want to achieve this because there is long distance between different zones. I think read from a slave in another zone is not a good idea. Of course failover need to be achieved also.
Can't get Redisson 1.1.7 to work in an OSGi container.Apologies if this is not the right forum to raise this bug.I have  been trying to deploy redisson to an OSGi container however I can't get v1.1.7 to work even though it's one of Radissons features. Here are some details of what I have so far found.Redisson has a "provided" scoped maven dependency on kryo (com.esotericsoftware.kryo:kryo:2.24.0), but the OSGi manifest imports com.esotericsoftware.kryo,version=[2.24,3)This means that the radisson OSGi bundle won't start up as it depends on kryo 2.24.*  Unfortunately due to an OSGi issue in Kryo (EsotericSoftware/kryo#189), there is no release of kryo after v2.24 that has the bug fixed (only v 3.0.0 which is too new according to the OSGi requirements of redisson - import com.esotericsoftware.kryo,version=[2.24,3)) . This means that Redisson 1.1.7 won't and can't work in an OSGi environment unless it is manually hacked.Kryo v 3.0.0 has been released that contains the OSGi fixes thus Redisson should probably be modified to utilise kryo v 3.0.0 to fix the OSGi issues. Also the dependency should be changed to be a compile time dependency (rather than provided) if radisson has a hard runtime depdency on kryo.If Kryo is not required at runtime (i.e. it's an optional dependency that can somehow be configured and sorry I haven't used radisson before so this is a newbie assumption) then the maven-bundle-plugin configuration could be changed to dynamically import kryo (see below) as and when it's needed. The upgrade to kryo v3.0.0 should still be considered.Also note that kryo maven groupId has changed to com.esotericsoftware.I hope you can help... thanks.

ClusterConnectionManager sets nodesValues as null.Hi,Following the examples given in the docs, I've initialized my cluster servers as follows:Now, I get a null pointer exception when I try to do Redisson.create using the above config. I've traced it down to the ClusterConnectionManager class, where the following is carried out:String nodesValue = connection.clusterNodes().awaitUninterruptibly().getNow();Nodes Value is always null, no matter which port i start redis server on (confirmed that it is running). I'd appreciate any guidance that you can give me as I'm stuck here and cannot proceed with my POC using Redisson otherwise.BTW, this works perfectly:
Promise timeout (temporary) resource leak.When a promise has been fulfilled the timeout task should be cancelled. Currently this is not the case and means that the (potentially very large) amounts of data included in the promise will remain on the heap until the timeout fires.An example:A request is made for a large (millions of entries) dataset.The promise is returned and then fulfilled.The data is consumed and the promise goes out of scope.repeat.What should happen is that the garbage collector should clean up the promise since it is now out of scope but this can't happen since the timeout task still has a reference to it so it remains in memory for 60 secs (deadline) and very quickly you get OOM.cc @group-papa @priyeshpatel.

Redisson and multiple like inserts.Lets suppose I have a list of some students - the current list has students with ids: 3,5,8. As I understand I don't need to use redis list here as I don't need to keep order. The order I don't need as it's clear it's just SOME of students. However I want to cache them.I think I need to use here redis type string and do something like db:stundents:{id}. My question - how can I do multiple insert of these three stundents? To insert one I use Bucket.set().
Redisson sorted set creates list in redis server.I do the following:but when I do../redis-cli.type test.it return "list". Why does redisson creates list and how can I do sorted set with scores using redisson?

Connection errors handling breaks redis watch/multi/exec semantics.Let's look into org.redisson.RedissonMap#replace(K, V, V)Good scenario:watch -> ok.hexists -> ok.multi -> ok.hset -> queued.exec -> ok.Bad scenario:watch -> ok.hexists -> ok.multi -> ok.hset -> operation timeout or other error handled by MasterSlaveConnectionManager#readAsync , retry on new connection, result ok.exec -> "exec without multi" failure.Impact: in bad scenario map content can be replaced with invalid value for key K.

RedisConnectionException when using Amazon ElastiCache.We encountered an issue when using Redisson to connect our application running on Ubuntu to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.When performing any operation Redisson throws a RedisConnectionException: Unable to connect xxxx.cache.amazonaws.com/10.xxx.xxx.xxx:6379. However, after installing the redis-tools package (using apt-get) the issue goes away and everything works correctly.Does Redisson requires the redis-cli binary or the redis-tools package? Did anyone had a similar issue?
KryoCodec strange behaviour.Between client restarts, KyroCodec serialisation randomly fails with exception;Prior to release this feature, did you run some regression tests for it? Also do you have any comment about the exception?P.S: Content of the redis and the classes are same between restarts and I am simply applying Predicate upon RMap.Edit: Between restarts, Kyro is sweeping the classes and give them uniqueIds in order to identify and serialise/deserialise them. I used to give Kyro exact list of classes in the exact order but with the auto discovery I think class loading order causes this issue right now.IMHO, best solution would be to provide an interface for registering the Kyro classes to the underlying KyroCodec impl.

Redisson and leap second.Hello,I am using redis and redisson for my service deployed on Amazon server. Server has older kernel version that suffers from leap second bug. Will it affect redis or redisson lock in any manner? If so what is the possible solution to it?
Reddison tries to connect to a slave which is down.Redisson library version: 1.2.1.Hi,We are using SentinelServersConfig and during the tests we observed that if a slave is down, and sentinel properly reports this by putting the s_down flag, Redisson still considers it at initialization and during the operation tries to connect to it.This affects badly the performance, since RoundRobin tries periodically send though that slave.WARN  o.r.c.RoundRobinLoadBalancer - Can't connect to /192.168.150.163:6379, trying next connection!As I see, the SentinelConnectionManager constructor does not check for the "s_down" flag when initializes the list of available slaves, thus the Redisson snapshot of slave status does not reflects the status of slave servers.

Are the recent Netty related features alerting Netty for other libraries?Today attempted to migrate Redisson from version 1.2.1 to 1.3.0 and that caused the 2.1.6 version of the DataStax Java driver to write a WARN + stack trace instead of an INFO to the log.With org.redisson:redisson:1.2.1, I see:With org.redisson:redisson:1.3.0, I see:I also tried version 2.2.0-rc1 of the DataStax Java driver and see the same thing.I also tried adding a dependency on io.netty:netty-transport-native-epoll:4.0.29.Final, which I believe contains the linux-x86_64 jars but still see the same thing.For reference, I'm deploying to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-44-generic x86_64).Please advise.Thanks,Peter Luttrell.

NullPointerException When Using Cluster Config.With release 2.0.0, while using sample cluster setup using the create-cluster script from redis (http) and this Redisson sample code:I always get the following NPE:
Redisson calls do not time out and very long cache times depending on ttl setting.Hi, while developing using redisson some problems with timeouts and cache times are experienced.Consider the following scenario:Now there are several problems here. Timeout exceptions are being thrown, but seemingly at random times ignoring the timeout setting of redisson. It is also somehow being affected by ttl setting as the shorter ttl yields lower cache times, as well as the frequency of hitting the cache. You can see it from the following graphs of CACHE_TIME timer:In all cases the timeout was set to 100ms, 3 attempts with 100ms interval. In all the cases in the end requests succeed to fall over to the database (either through a timeout error or through returning null). Regardless, the timeout is not being thrown according to the settings. Please let me know if you might know the cause of the issue. Thoroughly investigated the code on this side and it seems like the issue is in redisson. Let me know if you need more context.

Infinispan redis integration.I'm contributing a redis integration to infinispan and am investigating the use of Redisson to use as the client.I need an efficient way to retrieve a list of all keys and iterate over them for processing, but because Redis can store millions of records, I wanted to avoid a list/queue of data pulled from the Redis server and held in memory on the client as this could wind up exhausting resources on the client.Will getBuckets, findKeysByPattern or findKeysByPatternAsync retrieve the keys in an efficient manor, like a database cursor stepping over each record, or is there another approach that is recommended to efficiently cater for this?

Warnings about serialization exceptions being swallowed (using SerializationCodec with non-Serializable class)I wound up pulling my hair out after upgrading from 1.3.1 to 2.1.0 and starting some new projects - the root cause being my attempt to use the SerilizationCodec with objects that were not Serializable. Simplest reproduction:Expected: a warning about serialization with a root cause of a java.io.NotSerializableException.Actual: nothing in the logs, threads just hang around wait()ing on DefaultPromise.I'm not a netty expert so unfortunately I have no PR to fix this. My best guess at root cause lies in CommandExecutorService#async. If I modify the ChannelFutureListener to.I get a nice warning message:The listener originated in 2019283.

Cluster mode "Too many open files" (java.net.SocketException)Cluster mode Redisson client running out of files (sockets) in communicating with Redis.This occurs even when the Redisson client is not receiving any requests.  It must be a problem with cluster mode connectivity.To reproduce, I simply made two calls to my server using Redisson to set a simple value on Redis and then retrieve a simple value.  Then we did nothing at all.It appears the Redisson in cluster mode is continually opening new socket connections but not closing existing ones.After about an hour, we started seeing the following exceptions in our server logs.Note:  I am may have seen a similar behavior in sentinel mode.  We recently upgraded Redisson to 2.1.0 from 1.1.5.  Could this be a more general problem?  We will upgrade to 2.1.1 and test again.Thank you very much.--Michael.

Major Issue: iterators that uses SCAN/SSCAN/HSCAN command are not using the same node.Since the fact that keys/Sets/Hashes in redis does not guarantee the order of the elements within, iterators should stick to the same node when iteration was first started, to avoid duplicate and/or missing items.For example, when you have a Set "A" in master node contains:a slave node could have it in a completely different ordering:Obviously, the running the command SSCAN "A" 0 on master, the result is going to be different to the one from the slave. Further cursor call SSCAN "A" n, could also be different.The problem is, under the default setting, SentinelConnectionManager uses the RoundRobinBalancer which is utilised to read from both master and slave nodes, and when you have a for loop like this:The output could contain duplicate/missing item(s), and the results could be different each time you run it.
CommandBatchExecutor executeAsync method freezes.Hello,Nice work on the redis client.I noticed that executeAsync did not complete while running a batch of rediscommands against a cluster.I noticed that in the line:voidPromise may never complete successfully because it is being re-initialized for every slot entry and its successful completion depends on the number of slots being decremented to zero after all the entries run as shown in the line below from execute(...)Note that mainPromise is voidPromise from above.Perhaps the previous line in executeAsync should have been like.

Subscription connection leak in PubSubConnectionEntry::removeListener.We have a production system using Redisson to handle notification. However, recently we constantly run into subscription connection exhausted issue. After investigation, I found Redisson doesn't release the subscription connection after the last listener is removed.Eventually, this issue is caused by the following line. It seems ConcurrentLinedQueue doesn't fully implement equals method to compare 2 linked list. Therefore, an empty linked list will never equals to another empty linked list, which eventually leaks all subscription connections.This is a very urgent issue to us. Any help or workaround will be greatly appreciated.
Leak issues.When using redisson, I'm occasionally getting errors like this: "LEAK: you are creating too many HashedWheelTimer instances".What are possible causes of this issue?I'm also seeing (probably related) errors like this: "LEAK: HashedWheelTimer.release() was not called before it's garbage-collected." I assume this is related to my problem, but I don't know where to look in my code for this leak. Could this be a bug?Thanks!
Read split feature in Sentinel mode.Hi,I have a setup with a master, 3 slaves and 3 sentinel nodes. I do not have too much data and cluster setup is not required.

Is there any way to split read requests among master and slaves?If there is no way to do this, can this feature be added?Thanks.Naresh.
Elasticache and failover; Redisson configuration question.We're using Redisson 2.1.1 on our production web cluster for session persistence: https:Our redis implemention is AWS's ElastiCache where we have 2 nodes in a replication group. Elasticache provides 3 endpoints for this scenario:foobar.elasticache.com - always points to the primary (read/write) node of the cluster.Normally node1 is the read/write master and node2 is a read slave with foobar.elasticache.com pointing to node1. In a failover scenario. Elasticache promotes node2 and repoints foobar.elasticache.com to now point at node2.Our Redisson configuration is to use a SingleServerConfig with the endpoint of foobar.elasticache.com.Last night we experienced our first ever failover (exciting!). Unfortunately, this brought our application to a standstill with errors of.The 10.0.x.x address listed is that of node1 which was demoted to read slave when node2 was promoted to master.My belief is that using SingleServerConfig here is incorrect and led to this issue (i.e., redisson remained connected to node1 and never reconnected to foobar.elasticache.com to now be connected to node2. Am I correct in this analysis?  If so, I can't really seem to figure out which config is the proper one to use. MasterSlaveServersConfig seems logical at first glance, but looking through the code it appears only Sentinel and Cluster configurations invoke the paths that switch the master node.Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Fst and snappy codecs · Issue #245.No description provided.
Feature Request: Redisson backed ObjectCodec (Object-Hash Mapping)Now, the ability to specify a different codec per object feature is added.d484c19, this has paved the way to implement a new type of object codec that serialise each field of POJO object into a redis hash.Thinking it as a persistent layer for persisting an object to redis like the EntityManager does. Using reflection/javasisst to proxy the accessors of the POJO to read/write fields straight from/to redis.It would allow different programs to be able to share sets of live data without needing to serialise and deserialise the entire object.
Add serialization codec for java Number.By default any Number class descendants is serialized as ["java.lang.Long",1843] for example.

Redis master change is not detected properly.Redisson does not seem to be detecting Redis master change in failover scenario.  (We are using Redisson 2.1.3).I have 2 questions regarding this.After the 60-second timeout (described below) everything started working again, although not in the original configuration.  Can this timeout be changed (lowered) and done so safely?Should Redisson should be able to detect and react to this last master change back to our original configuration?  We were assuming that it should.Details are below.I can provide the redis commands we used to reconfigure Redis if they will help.Thank you very much.--Michael.In testing redis failover we have discovered that moving a master instance frmo one instance to another causes all our servers to hang.  We have reproduced the issue several times with the following process.We are running 3 Redis servers (redis-01, redis-02, and redis-03).  Each server is running both a redis master and a redis slave.  Each master is associated with a slave on one of the other redis servers.Start multiple work sessions on our application servers running light load.[At this point everything appears great - the test continues to run.  The slave instance has taken over the responsibilities for the failed redis node.  run "redis-cli cluster nodes" for a list of all the nodes, the reassigned master and a list of the failed shards.].restart redis on the "failed" server - "service redis_master start" "service redis_slave start".[After 60 seconds, we see our first indication of trouble - we get a redis connection timeout exception on each of the application servers.  If you look at the "cluster node" output you should see the two instances back in the list, however at this point they are both slave nodes.  Another server will have two master instances on it.].rebalance the redis nodes - on the server that you just restarted the services, run "redis-cli cluster failover" this tells redis to failover the remote master to this instance.  After this step you should be back to the original configuration with one master and one slave instance on each server, with no master/slave combination on the same server.This is where our application servers seem to hang.  From yourkit we see several of these:

NPE during load testing.Hi.I'm relatively new to java, so sorry if i say something stupid.When i'm storming my server with 50 concurrent requests using AB, i'm getting NPE during some channel negotiating (as i guess). The following line (CommandDecoder:267):results in null pointer exception:I'm not 100% sure where does this problem originate from, but i can tell that those requests use Redisson for inter-process locks and fetching/updating two string sets.I'm using Redisson 2.1.3 against dockerized Redis 3.0.2 (the standard docker library image)upd: debugger told me that client has received null for hannels.get() for redisson__lock__channel__{lock:pn:phone-number:79219767095}, which, i guess, means trouble with lock.

AddSentinelAddress(...) non-running instance ClosedChannelException.Hi,I have noticed something running some load tests recently.I have a 3 sentinels, 1 slave and 1 master set up.Initially I was running load tests on this exact set up and would occasionally run into org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException: Slave connection pool gets exhausted! which is fine since when the load is reduced the app goes back to normal.Then I had to switch off one of the sentinels and forgot to restart it, so now I was running with 2 sentinels, 1 slave and 1 master.I would first again run into org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException: Slave connection pool gets exhausted! but would also run into.After reducing the load, org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException: Slave connection pool gets exhausted! disappear, but org.redisson.client.WriteRedisConnectionException: Can't send command... persist and appear on every couple of calls even for 0.5QPS.I tried this several times and it always was like this, 3 sentinels - all good, 2 sentinels - WriteRedisConnectionException exceptions.Note that in both cases I passed all 3 sentinel's addresses to addSentinelAddress(...) for useSentinelConnection()Maybe a check on the new Redis(...) call to ping all the sentinels would be nice.

RedissonSet iterator in Sentinel mode doesn't seem to be sticking to one slave for the lifetime of the iterator.Hi,I have a Redis setup with 3 nodes (master, slave, slave) and 3 sentinels (one per node). When I try to iterate over a set within Redis, I'm getting some odd results that are breaking the Redis SCAN guarantees - that is, I'm losing some entries.I'm pretty sure this is because the iterator isn't sticking to a single slave during its lifetime, and rather that it's using the default RoundRobinLoadBalancer switching between slaves for the same scan (which otherwise works well).Example.Let's say I have a big set with 100K entries:with all nodes up (two slaves), and when iterating over the collection, adding all my results to a java.util.Set such as below, then I'm getting some random size result sets:However, if I turn off a slave, I get the correct result:and I agree with the behavior of the RScript (as Redisson would never implicitly know when to stick to a single server). Incidentally, the latter use of RScript provides me with a workaround, but it'd be nice to use the inbuilt iterators for simplicity.Hope that make sense-cheers!

What does RBatch.execute() return?Hello. I have an RBatch variable that I've added some commands to. I noticed if I tax redis a bunch sometimes it has trouble writing a backup file (this might be the fault of my weak vm). At any rate, I'd like to detect this failure mode and tell the user about it if it ever happens.I'm trying to figure out what RBatch.execute returns. There aren't any javadocs on this. I either get one of two responses:The second one indicates failure.The wiki suggests these are responses to the specific commands, which agrees with what I would assume from EXEC, but I'm not sure why I'm getting boolean results, because the commands I'm running should all be add commands (like HSET, ZADD, etc).Do you mind updating the javadoc, and do you know why I'm getting booleans back (and what they mean) instead of ints?

RScript.Mode.READ_ONLY... not read only?I have a script that deletes some things. Here's how I'm executing it:myRScript.evalSha(Mode.READ_ONLY, mySha, ReturnType.BOOLEAN, myKeyNames);It's working (deleting things). This is confusing to me. Shouldn't Mode.READ_ONLY not allow that? I think what is happening is this is using redis' READONLY command, which I think is okay with letting me change data, as long as I'm not hitting a slave (which I'm not, because I'm only running one node locally). I think this will cause an issue once I run this on something like Amazon's ElastiCache.Do you know if my assumptions about what's happening are correct? I wasn't able to figure that out. If so, maybe adding some documentation to that enum would make things less confusing. If not, maybe there's a bug? Anyway I'll start using Mode.READ_WRITE, but I thought it was strange that Mode.READ_ONLY worked too, so I figured I'd report it.

Redisson cluster Read connections issue.I use Redisson 2.2 to implement distributed lock in my project and use Redis cluster.  And I found the Redisson client will create new connection and do not use the connection in the pool while invoke some readOnly methods which execute evalRead. So when I start to run the test it will produce lots of TIME_WAIT connection on my server. The followings are some logs on my server.The codes are very spectacular and I only understand a bit. But I doubt whether the client get the connection from the pool but also create a new one?

Running out of connections.I use Elasticache Redis as my redis server, 1 master, 1 slave (fairly large machine, this is an autoscaling micro webservice).  I used to use an older version and it worked good (from a connections point of view), but I had to upgrade from 2.1.2 due to distributed lock fixes. I am currently using 2.2.4, but after about 12-24 hours I see the " RedisConnectionException:Can't aquire connection from pool! " exceptions.I expected it had to do with Elasticache closing idle connections, so I turned that back off for now, but it didn't effect this behavior, it seems to be related with my update from 2.1.2 to 2.2.4.Does redisson not refresh its connection pool as connections close, do they timeout, or is this something else entirely?I am using SingleServer or MasterSlave Configuration, with defaults, the current behavior is seen with SingleServer. (I haven't added configurations for slaves yet)The only functionality I currently use in Redisson is the Distributed lock mechanism, to control 2 sets of locks.Flow of using lock: get lock, set expire to 15s, (try) process,(finally) unlock (or set lock to expire in 500ms)Redis has plenty of connections available. only 1300 or so used out of about 7k.

orphan netty threads on connection failure.If you try to create a RedissonClient and get a timeout error, the created netty threads aren't destroyed and you can never terminate the Java program but with a System.exit(). For example:If this code fails, then several netty threads remain in execution and they are never destroyed, because the "client" variable is the only point where you can "shutdown" those threads, but that RedissonClient instance hasn't been created (because an exception has been thrown).A possible solution is to shutdown the failed connection at MasterSlaveConnectionManager.init(), which is the point that all kind of connection managers run to create a connection.

Async version of RSetMultimap/RListMultimap.Is there a plan to implement RSetMultimapAsync and RListMultimapAsync?
Missing entries in RMapAsync using single redis server and multiple web servers in servlet enviornment.I am testing out using RMapAsync to store connected users to our web service in a servlet environment with two or more web servers and one redis server.  When a user creates or removes a session, I'm adding/removing to the RMapAsync like so:and similarly, when a session is removed:I am seeing that there are a few hundred missing with a total user count of 3K or so.  Is this possibly because the same redis key/hashmap is being altered simultaneously from more than one server?  Is it best to get the map and edit it like I'm doing here? or would it be better to have one class member instance of the map in my class and just add remove in the relevant methods (so I'm not continuously calling get map for every add/remove)?  What's the best practice for a setup like this if this isn't a bug, but a misuse of the RMapAsync?  (awesome project btw)

Allow injecting custom ConnectionManager.Use case:Redis clustering is implemented using twemproxy, and its location should be discovered and monitored using Consul, etcd or whatever else. Currently I have to either use DNS monitoring (which is not an option in some cases) or wrap Redisson instances into a proxy to implement this. It would be better to have an option to implement such behavior in custom ConnectionManager.I can make pull request with implementation, if anyone else needs this.

Is Redisson a good candidate for session manager?I know my question is not an issue but I couldn't find a better way to get an answer, sorry!Would you recommend Redisson as a session manager (as in HttpSession)?Spring Session comes with a clustered version using Redis but it does not support locks (AFAIK) and personally I find that useless. Then I found this project and it sounds suitable but there's so much to consider and trying to get advise from the community I thought this is the best place to ask.

Long latency issue while call Redis.I use Redisson 2.2.10 to implement distributed lock in my project. And then I run load test for this distributed lock using SINGLE redis mode. But I found there are many long latency APIs and it's wired that almost all the long latency APIs are a little greater than 1000ms. The average latency and 99 percent latecy is about 15ms and 30ms respectively. And then I used jstack to get the call stack and found most of the threads are WAITING at the same place just as the following.Meanwhile, during the test, I dumped the network packages using tcpdump and found that it took about 1000ms before the first package was sent to Redis. And in Redis server, I didn't find any slow query whose latency is more than 10ms. So I think, for the long latency API, most of the time might be cost in the project not the network. So can you help me to have a check or give me some suggestion about this issue?  Many thanks.

RedisTimeoutException with "large" objects.I have a simple setup with a SingleServer connected to a ElasticCache-Redis instance. I upload various sizes of bytes to measure the performance between those. Small objects up to 3 MB perform fine but above that I receive this error:In "Batch" mode is also see this:My setup for connecting looks as following (I have a similar setup with redisson-reactive showing the same problem):I have tried using the latest versions (release + HEAD). I have debugged the issue but haven't found any obvious problem. The only thing I found is the timeout in "new HashedWheelTimer(minTimeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);" which is set to a 100ms (from MasterSlaveConfig) and seems to be the reason for cancelling the commands? Though I tried changing this without success.Somebody has an idea about what might be causing the timeouts? Can I configure those to be suitable for bigger objects?

RSetCache TTL doesnt readd after expiry via RSetCache.add.I have a problem with a RSetCache with TTL.   The problem seems to be that the value is not returned from the iterator and calling readAll throws an exception.Redisson : 2.2.12.Redis : 3.0.7 (00000000/0) 64 bit.I have attached a test which reproduces the issue.When I run this, it keeps adding a string into the set and it should expire but be replaced quickly, this doesn't happen and the set is empty after the 30 seconds.Calling readAll() on the set it fails with the following error.hscan testRSetCacheTTL 0.shows the value in the set while its running and after (when I disable the delete() call).Also note that removing the delete() call seems to stop the exception from readAll().  So using readAll() with no delete() works or using delete() without the readAll().   But I have a feeling that it could be timing related.

RedissonRemoteService: executorsAmount vs invokeMethod.This is more a question than an issue, and please excuse me if this is a dumb question, I may be wrong, I am just beginning to dig into the code.Here I suppose that the clients are able to issue calls more quickly that the servers can respond to.In RedissonRemoteService, is it possible that the server ends up invoking simultaneously more than the expected executorsAmount given that it re-subscribe before the invokeMethod, and even before the ack ?
RedissonRemoteService ideas.Here, two things that would be great additions (I think) to the RedissonRemoteService.1) Be able to choose the remote service interface prefix.Right now its hardcoded to redisson_remote_service:.The use case is simple: for example I want to be able to deploy the same worker application (that expose the same service) on two types of instances (say some AWS m3-* for standard use, and some c4-* for hardcore use).So on the server side I would call:And on the client side:1) Be able to issue one-way call (ie: wait for the ack, but not the actual response)This could be a client side only change, for example, by having a new set of RRemoteService.get(...) methods, that takes a boolean waitForResponse...Or, maybe, re-use the RRemoteService.get(...)'s long executionTimeout, where a value of executionTimeout < 0 would indicate to the client to wait for the ack, but not the actual response.

Storing simple key/value pairs in RMap vs. RBucket.Sorry for using an issue for my question, but I couldn't find a mailing list to post this question to :)I am using Redisson to store key/value pairs and was wondering whether it makes more sense to use just plain RBuckets for each pair or a single RMap. I am especially interested in the possibility of sharding these across nodes in a cluster setup (PRO feature?). The key/value pairs are immutable and I would expect a lof of PUTs and DELETEs of them. Any pros and cons?I do also use a lot of different "types" (around 8) of caches (with different serializations and TTLs). Currently I am using a different redis databases  for each type. This means I have to create a new connection (aka RedisonClient) for each of these. This also means a lot of Threads in the different ThreadPools, though I am already sharing the EventLoopGroup between the instances. Would there be any particular drawback in storing all of these in just one database to avoid the Thread overhead?Thanks in advance!

Scalability of Channels (Pub/Sub)I'm building a real-time text based chat program where people can chat with ONLY 1 other person.Each person can chat with 1 other person, but the aim is they can chat with Many people at once. (i.e. MANY one to one chats with different people). The aim is to have it scaleable, not necessarily to snapchat's level, but enough for 1 City.I'm just wondering what is more scaleable:Having 1 channel for the entire application and filtering who the message is for and who sent the message based on the data encoded in the message.OR.Having 1 channel for each person and all the different people sending messages to that person send their messages through that channel with data encoding who sent the message.OR.Have an individual channel for EACH Chat between 2 people.OR.For Option 1 (1 channel for entire app), perhaps an intermediate solution of having 1 channel per city.I'm wondering what approach is best for Java and Redis. If there is no clear cut answer, what the conditions/criteria are for making the decision.

ConnectionListener.onConnect()/onDisconnect() are not invoked when redis server becomes active/inactive.I am trying to utilize ConnectionListener to monitor connections to redis servers. The way I add connection listener is pretty similar to the sample code showing in wiki 9.1:The way I test it:start two redis server on port 6379, 6380, let server on port 6380 to be the slave.setup and start redis client. I am using ElasticacheServersConfig here.Once all connections are stable, kill redis master server and check output.However, what I saw is onDisconnect() of my listener is never invoked after I shut down my redis server. If I restart my redis server again, I can see connectionEventHub.fireConnect() is called. But since the check maps.get(addr) == Status.CONNECTED always return true, my listener.onConnect() is also not invoked.Can anybody help explain why this happens? Did I misunderstand what connection listeners should be used for? Thanks in advance.The version I am using is redisson-2.2.13.Below is the console output after master is down.

Cannot create Redisson Client if it cannot connect to the only Slave in SLAVE and MASTER_SLAVE read mode.Hi all.As the issue title says, we cannot create Redisson Client if it cannot connect to the only Slave in SLAVE and MASTER_SLAVE read mode. While this looks like the expected behaviour, since creation of RedissonClient object can be very critical for an application startup, may be the redisson library can fallback to something more forgiving, like using the Master for reads with some error logs.We have encountered this issue due to firewall rules not being setup correctly (which can happen, no matter how much effort is put in) and the consequence of this was our app did not start up and the deployment had to be rolled back. We couldn't explain why Redisson Client cannot be created when the connection to the Master was working, until I tested it out using the unit test below.We have fixed up the firewall rules, but just wanted to inform as this feels like a rough edge. By the way, we were using 2.2.13 and this issue seems to be in the latest release 2.2.24 as well.Thanks.The setup used for the unit test below is:testReadModeSlave and testReadModeMaster tests fail with the following error:I have also seen the following error when running the tests above, but does not seem to happen consistently:
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero in WeightedRoundRobinBalancer if the connections to the only Slave are frozen.I was trying to use the WeightedRoundRobinBalancer to give preference to a Redis server over another for reads and encountered java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero. Following is the unit test and the stacktace. Interestingly, this error happens only when the slave is given an higher weight; if the master is given a weight of 2 and slave a weight of 1, then the error does not occur.The setup used for the unit test below is:Sentinels running on localhost:5000, localhost:5001 and localhost:5002.All the above processes running in a guest VM.With port forwarding setup from host to guest for 6379, 6380, 5001, 5001 and 5002.But the slave on the guest had the bind configuration to listen only on 127.0.0.1. i.e. connections from host wouldn't work.

Q: To use RedissonRedLock locking mechanism do we need to create multiple locks?My use case is simple (I think). I need to make sure that for a specific keyspace, only one client can create an entry i.e. akey with value for it. If multiple threads/clients etc access the "creation" method at the very same time, then only the first one should get access to create the entry & all others should be rejected.I was trying to accomplish using the following code snippet.But this seems to not work at all. I executed this method using executor service, where I ran 2 threads in parallel.And it seems that one of the threads gets is able create the lock, do the work & unlock it. But the second one is not even able to get the lock & the method never finishes execution.After I changed the locking mechanism to Fair Lock things work as expected.I am not sure why this is? Is it because of the fact that the RedissonRedLock expects multiple locks? But I dont think I would need that in my case.FYI here is the snippet of code I use to paralelly start 2 executions.Am I doing something wrong?
Duplicate objects in a set.Hi,I seem to be able to create duplicate POJO objects in a Redisson distributed set. The implementation doesn't seem to call equals(), which I find odd.

Trouble with change from io.netty.util.concurrent.Future to org.redisson.api.RFuture.I'm updating our app to use Redisson 2.3.0, and I'm having some trouble with the breaking change (io.netty.util.concurrent.Future to org.redisson.api.RFuture).Previously, I had been using the fastPutAsync method for RMapAsync like this:I'm trying to change that Future<Boolean> (which is the netty Future) to RFuture, but I'm having a bit of trouble getting it right. All I'm really after is being able to log success/failures of the fastPutAsync() method.How would this be accomplished using the RFuture?

Implement Semaphore.reducePermits method.No description provided.
Implement PermitExpirableSemaphore.In some cases ability to acquire permit with leaseTime is required. It's not possible to implement it with standard Semaphore object, because it's impossible to determine which permit should be expired. Example:1. client #1 acquires 1 permit with leaseTime = 30 seconds.2. client #2 acquires 1 permit with leaseTime = 15 seconds.3. client #2 or someone else releases 1 permit.How to know which timeout should be deleted in this case for 30 seconds or 15 seconds?To overcome this problem each acquired permit should have own unique id - 128-bits random number (UUID). So new RSemaphoreWithIds object should be introduced. Thus client could release only own acquired permits. If it tries to release wrong id or same id second time exception would be thrown.

MasterConnectionPool exhausted!  Hosts with fully busy connections.I am using a RScheduledExecutorService as a job queue backed by a java ThreadPoolExecutor:Other code schedules jobs on the executor. The problem I have is that after a while if the service is busy it eventually runs out of connections.I added some hackery to get info on the number of free connections and print this periodically:The freeConnectionsCounter + freeConnectionsAmount value started dropping as more and more requests are executed. It doesn't drop one-for-one with requests so at least some of the time connections are being released. Interesting if the server gets less busy for a while before running out of connections then suddenly a bunch get released and things recover.Any idea whats going on here and how I can fix this? Tx.

InputStream and OutputStream support.From Gitter user @cdeszaq:Wanting to keep memory usage within my app as low as possible. We're getting large collection-like responses from a backend system, processing them "item" at a time, and we want to be able to cache that response in a streamy way.Needs to keep memory low are many concurrent requests, large collections of things processed a streamy way, and we're hitting issues with OOM due to having large strings flying around.It's a CSV response from a back-end webservice, so we process it in a streamy way, but it'll easily get to sizes of 100MB for each response, and we often have to have 30+ of these responses being processed at once. We process it 1 row at a time within our code to keep memory low, but hit OOM when we go to/from our current caching layer because it converts to/from massive strings.

Configured Timeout in ElasticCacheServerConfig being ignored.Hello,I am using Redisson library version 2.2.4. I have the following settings configured for when I want to create a Redisson Client object for connecting to the datastore.As you can see from the above settings I am setting the timeout explicitly to be 3 seconds. But I am seeing exceptions in the log which says mentions 1 second timeout. Here is the exception,I am wondering how is this is possible? Also I think there is also auto-retry feature in Redisson, which defaults to 3 attempts. Then why would this happen?Can I provide some more info to debug this issue?

Redisson JUnit tests due leaks connections/clients/threads.If you run the JUnit tests for Redisson a lot of client and their associated connections/threads are leaking because they are not properly shutdown. This will prevent the build to be successful on system with limited number of user-processes/open-files (i.e. MacOS El Capitain).To verify this, build the project with an attached debugger and watch the constantly growing amount of threads.
Add BlockingFairQueue implementation.In case when queue consumers in different parts of network: some of them closer to redis and some farther."Farther" consumers will get lower amount of messages from queue due to network delays.

IndexOutOfBoundsException when reading from RMapCache.I am using Redisson 3.2.0 and currently facing a problem reading for a cached collection. The following error is thrown.
Inconsistent Behavior in RListMultimap.I'm seeing a scenario in which RListMultimap.keySet() will return an empty set in spite of the fact that I have confirmed that data exists in the map.  The same goes for keySet().size() as well as simply calling size() on the map.I captured the behavior .  Note that the in the expression editor the sizes are even though I had just immediately inserted the value into the map.  I also have confirmed that my local Redis instance actually contains the keys mentioned.I tried to write a test case to demonstrate the issue, but it seems to work fine when running my test case.  However, I'm a bit perplexed to see it happening in my production code.Could this be related to serialization or string encoding?  I dug pretty deep into Redisson's source code, but I had a hard time pinning down where in the client it actually issues the KEYS command to determine the keyset of the map.I'd be happy to continue writing a test case, and a fix if necessary but I'm having difficulty reproducing the issue.  Any thoughts?
Improvements to ClusterConnectionManager.Currently we are running Redisson on hundreds of application servers to communicate with a redis cluster acting as cache. During a restart of the app servers there is a stampeding of the herd that can result in slower responses from the cluster. For our application we want to ensure that the cluster is available so we have a long connectTimeout. However we don't want to wait very long on key lookups (since we can bypass the cache if needed) so we have a short commandTimeout. In other words, we can tolerate occasional slow lookups, but we abort startup of our application if the redis cluster is not available.As part of ClusterConnectionManager instantiation, ClusterNodeInfo is retrieved synchronously via RedisCommands.CLUSTER_NODES. It would be nice if this command respected the connectTimeout value rather than commandTimeout.Example stacktrace of timeout leading to initialization failure:

Divide by zero error in RedissonBloomFilter contains() when bloom filter is empty.If a user of Redisson sets up a RBloomFilter (the bloom filter has been successfully initialized) but does not populate it with any values, a call to the contains() method will throw a Divide By Zero exception.  The exception occurs within the hash() method when an attempt is made to use the mod operation with a size of zero.(hash & Long.MAX_VALUE)%size;A value of false should be returned instead.  It is reasonable that a bloom filter would be created but might be populated after application startup with values encountered by the running application.Using Redisson 3.2.2.

Just trying to help brainstorm: any chance to catch & log/warn & move on? Above Error prevents Redisson from being loaded/used, not just that particular protocol handling...
Right usage of persist since getOrCreate is deprecated.Hi There,What's the right usage of persist method since getOrCreate was deprecated on #639 ?Thanks,Tiago.
Wiki sidebar is a bit difficult to use.The wiki is a great resource, but currently the sidebar is rather difficult to use. There are two things I think might be improved.First, the wiki sidebar is sorted lexically, so the items appear in the order 1, 10, 11, 12 ... 2, 20, 21 ... I don't think github has an option to change how the pages are sorted so it's probably easy to just prefix each single digit page number with a 0, so 01, 02, ... 09, 10, 11 ... The table of contents could also be 00 to make it appear as the first item in the sidebar.Second, every page is also in Chinese. I think it's awesome that the documentation has multi language support, but github doesn't have good support for wikis in multiple languages. Since both English and Chinese pages are side-by-side in the sidebar, only 7 pages are easily accessible without expanding the sidebar all the way. This obviously doesn't scale well as docs are added for more languages. Perhaps we could prefix the page number with an identifying code for the language so that the lexical sorting groups them together?Thoughts? @jackygurui.

NullPointerException on some weird Redis cluster status.Hi,I use redisson 3.2.3 on my project. I try to do some Resilience test and sometimes i had this exception :As you can see, node 299302f881862c83c4f4046df9da28a068b76b40 is slave of f19eb78f3165b800f8b2189f307c1ba1d3563476 which is a another slave (Maybe a redis bug ?)So ClusterConnectionManager.parsePartitions generate for that slave a line like that.I'm not sur how, but it seem after that there is no other scheduleClusterChangeCheck and  this is a big probleme.I hope this is clear. (Sorry about my english, i'm a french guy).I'm going to to do a PR for this particular problem, but i want help to understand why this NullPoint completly kill the scheduleClusterChangeCheck thread.

Tomcat Session Manager with Multiple Tomcat Instances.Hi,I am trying to have tomcat session to be stored in centralized location using redisson in order to have load balancing on tomcat instances.I have two tomcat machines behind Load Balancer. Redis stored on one of the machines. Following are the contents of redisson.conf.address is same for both the tomcat machines.I am assuming that the session for both the tomcat machines are stored in the same location and accessed from the same location. But that is not happening. Please let me know if I am missing anything here.Regards,Rajesh.
Redisson Sentinel and pub/sub.Is there a simple way I'm missing to get the current master from redisson setup using sentinel?  I'd like to subscribe to channels/topics but only on the current master as reported via sentinel.  When I subscribe to a topic, it chooses a server randomly, but I'd like to keep it to the master so I can get the number of subscribers and number of received publishes (external app doing the publishing to communicate with Java app via redis pub/sub), which doesn't work when you publish to master and subscribe on a slave (although the message is received, just no stats).I figure either one of two solutions would work.  Query sentinel for the current master and then setup singleServer client to that master or would setting the SentinelServersConfig to read from master work to limit the redissonClient to master only? i.e.What would be the ideal way to setup the redisson client to subscribe to channels/topics so the publisher (ext app) can see those nubmers for subscribers and msg received etc ?As always, thanks for any help you provide.

Redisson connects to slaves of other masters.When sentinel announces a new slave:+slave slave 1.1.1.1:6379 1.1.1.1 6379 @ redis-master-A 2.2.2.2 6379.redisson adds this slave to its configuration but it does not check if it's a slave of the master used by redisson. As a result redisson attempts to connect to another cluster.The issue is in SentinelConnectionManager.onSlaveAdded.

Redisson Client Memory Issues.Hello,I've been stress-testing Redis using Redisson as the client in single server mode and am experiencing steady memory consumption as I increase the client transaction rate, to the point of memory exhaustion.  Indeed, it appears Redisson connections are using gigabytes of memory.  I'm performing simple batch gets (see code snippet below).I'm initializing and sharing the Redisson client via a simple singleton:My Redis instance has about 54 million keys and uses about 20GB of memory.Any advice you could provide would be much appreciated.Thanks!HarryTheHawk.

Using redisson as JCache implementation AND for session replication.We want to use redisson for JCache and for Tomcat session replication.However, if we place the two jars inside the /lib folder (as explained by the documentation), the serialization of cached objects fails (ClassNotFoundException). And if we place them in the application, the application will not start because the application context initialization cannot find the RedissonSessionManager.How can we configure redisson for both use cases?

IllegalStateException when accessing an invalidated session.Just using TomEE (Tomcat), when I invalidate a session using session.invalidate();, the next request the browser sends still has the old JSESSIONID. Tomcat doesn't seem to care about that, creates a new session and changes the cookie.With redisson however, I get the exception posted below.It seems that the ManagerBase does not return a session with the given ID, which is correct since the session was invalidated earlier, but then a new RedissionSession is created with that same ID which in turn leads to the exception.After that, a new session seems to be created elsewhere, as the response contains a new JSESSIONID.
Call Config.fromJson(File file) method, throws StackOverflowError.When call Config.fromJson(File file) method, throws StackOverflowError, because loop call itself.The following java test code:
Use PSETEX for time to live with precision of less than second.Right now only usage of SETEX is mapped.Therefore even though the API allows setting ttl using value(long) and TimeUnit.Using values like 1500ms gets translated into 1s, since it's using SETEX command which only takes seconds.And using values like 700ms gets translated to 0s, which makes the command fail by being an invalid SETEX parameter ("ERR invalid expire time in setex").Unless there is performance/memory implication i am not aware, using PSETEX for higher precision should cover that.
DelayedQueue.remve(),DelayedQueue.remveAll() can't work,the element has not been deleted.I deleted the element, but still can consume the element.
More modular/optional dependency management.We are using Redisson in an OSGi environment and have a lot of trouble with updating to new versions due to additional dependencies being introduced for optional features.In OSGi we have to make sure that appropriate bundles are available for each mvn-dependecy (whether they are only compile time or runtime) b/c the mvn-bundle-plugin will generate "Import-Packages" for these. As said that had been kind of a burden in the past b/c not all dependencies are available as OSGi-bundles.By optional features I am mostly talking about different compression-, serialization-algorithms, javax.cache-api, Spring-Cache, etc.I have somewhat two ideas around this:(simplistic, short term): mark dependencies for "optional" features as an optional mvn-dependeny. By that the mvn-bundle-plugin will also mark the "Import-Packages" as optional.(sophisticated, long term): split up the redisson library into a core-library which contains only the core functionality. Create separate projects for each compression and serialization. Which only contain the implementation of the CODEC, etc. The same for Spring- and javax.cache: they should really be two different libraries which build upon the core library. Every user can then decide which libraries need to be added to the project.
redisson-tomcat-8-3.3.1.jar not compatible with Tomcat 8.5.2.Using redisson-tomcat-8-3.3.1.jar inside a TomEE 7.0.0, which in turn is based on Tomcat 8.5.2, leads to the exception below.

JSR107 cache implementation should throw javax.cache.CacheException.The redisson JSR107 org.redisson.jcache.JCache implementation throws exception like org.redisson.client.RedisException. According to the JSR107 specification this exception should be wrapped into javax.cache.CacheException . This way when interchanging cache implementation one can expect same error handling.
Spring boot with redisson 3.3.2, 2.8.2 fails without optional actuator dependency.Actuator is an optional feature in Spring Boot, there are a lot of projects that do not use actuator due to additional dependencies and complexity.Redisson 3.3.1 worked fine without actuator but 3.3.2 fails to start with ClassNotFoundException for org.springframework.boot.actuate.cache.CacheStatisticsProvider.Suggested change registers Redisson AutoConfiguration only if actuator is in the classpath.Pull request #851.That pull request is only for 3.0.0 but change changes apply for the master branch.

Support STORE for GEORADIUS and GEORADIUSBYMEMBER.With GEORADIUS | GEORADIUSBYMEMBER ... STORE key, Redis stores the result to the specified key, and returns the result size.I see two ways to implement this into the Redisson API:Add new radiusStore...() methods to RGeo and RGeoAsync, with a fromKey parameter. Search the Geo specified by fromKey, and store the result in this RGeo. This mirrors the API for intersecting and unioning sorted sets.GEORADIUS fromKey ... STORE getName()Add new radiusStore...() methods to RGeo and RGeoAsync, with a storeKey parameter. Search this Geo, and store the results in the Geo specified by storeKey. This is more straightforward to implement.GEORADIUS getName() ... STORE storeKey.Which is preferred? Are there alternate suggestions? I vote for # 1.

How to listen for changes to an RMap (migrating from Hazelcast)?I'm investigating moving from Hazelcast to Redisson and one question popped up that I can't seem to work out the answer for. Perhaps I'm trying to incorrectly compare functionality between the two?Anyway, in our code that uses Hazelcast, we create a distributed IMap and add listeners so that each process (Hazelcast client) can listen for changes to that map. I can't seem to work out how to get the same functionality using the RMap. Is this possible or is this functionality only available using the LiveObject? Or do I have to mimic this functionality using a topic perhaps?Thanks.

Composite Spring Cache resolution Bug.When I use CompositeCacheManager with many different CacheManagers, for example:where commonCacheManager - is a  CaffeineCacheManager and redissonCacheManager is a RedissonSpringCacheManager, and when I try to use @Cacheable(value = "cacheName"), there is a bug in discovering a needed cache.The deal is - spring trying to find cache by its name from @Cacheable and it's iterating through all registered caches in composite manager, calling  getCache(String name) in every cacheManager.The problem is - in another cache managers there is an additional variable for dynamic getting cache and usual discovering. When you make a simple cacheManager.getCache("cache"), method getCache() creates a new cache if it's null and it's normal, but in dynamic resolving as in the @Cacheable annotation getCache() should return null.Here is an example, how it's done in CaffeineCacheManager:

Data deserialization error after upgrade to version 2.9.2.I upgraded Redisson to 2.9.2 and several JsonMappingException occurred:Looking for why it happened i discovered that it happens because support for @ConstructorProperties was added only in Jackson 2.7 version (FasterXML/jackson-databind#905) and in this commit c14e97c jackson was downgraded to 2.6.7 to maintain JDK 1.6 compatibility.According to Jackson release notes, still be possible to use Jackson 2.7 on Java 6:@mrniko can i open a pull request to upgrade jackson to 2.7.6 again?

Any way to get a list of all the map caches in Redisson?I may have missed this, but is there a way to get a list of all the map caches in Redisson? I have this functionality in my hazelcast based code that I am trying to update and it's useful to use for logging.Thinking about it, this feature would be useful for other collections and objects etc.Thanks.
Using locks to synchronize master/standby functionality?I'm using a lock in Hazelcast to implement "single master" functionality for service applications. Hazelcast's lock is release when the owner dies.So basically, say I have two applications that provide the same service, called A and B. A and B both start, but B grabs the lock for that service. B becomes ACTIVE and starts its processing. A becomes STANDBY and waits for that lock.B dies, the lock is released. A grabs the lock and it becomes ACTIVE and starts its processing.B restarts, tries to grab the lock but fails, so it becomes STANDBY and it waits for the lock.Now I read in a ticket that a lock is still held when the owning process dies, which is counter to what I need.Can you make any suggestions how to implement this functionality in Redisson?Thanks again.
Question with AWS Elasticache Redis cluster.Questions.I recently switched from Hazelcast to Redisson and I have a question about the cluster mode and sharding.When I create my configuration, should I use useClusterServers method or another?Which nodes address should I add? All? One node per shard? Other?The great feature of the cluster mode is the ability to partition data accross shards. But I'm asking myself if it is automatically done by AWS? Actually, I saw in the documentation that the RClusteredLocalCachedMap is a pro feature, but by using RLocalCachedMap and AWS redis, does the sharding works as if I was using RClusteredLocalCachedMap? Or you "simply" put the data in all the nodes I provide at start?Is there an auto-discovery features of all nodes so I don't have to hardcode endpoint addresses in the application?Thanks,
Exception when removing entry from a map cache.I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here but I'm getting an exception when I remove an entry from the map cache, using the KryoNet encoder. I can put an entry into the map cache but I can't remove from it.Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks.
Feature like EntryProcessor.Would it be possible in the future to have a feature which can get entries matching a Predicate?With an EntryProcessor i could have the ability to get all MyObject in the map that match a == "hello" for instance.

Clarification on RLocalCachedMap.Just looking for some clarification on how the RLocalCachedMap works.The documentation says it's better suited for read heavy operations (and less network round trips), which sounds perfect for something I'm implementing currently, which is a small map of runtime configurations (for simple settings like max for this and limit on that etc... Then the map in redis can be altered externally, and in turn my application without having to restart, since it's a service)My question is does the RLocalCachedMap periodically update it's values from Redis every so often?  If so, how frequent?  If not, is there a mechanism to force it to update?  Would RLocalCachedMap be a good use case for having update on the fly, runtime config vals?Thanks and keep up the awesome work!P.S.Using Redisson 3.4.3 (sentinel master/slave setup), and Java 8 on Centos linux 64bit.

Live Object with Map<> field.I am trying to use a Live Object with a Map<DateTime, T> field. I use the rLiveObjectService.merge() to persist to Redis.I can retrieve the Live Object OK using get(), but the Map field is always empty.

[Question] Netty dependencies problems / shading.Since netty keeps being a source of headaches sometimes, specially when using this library in combination with Play Framerwork or AsyncHttpClient or gRPC, as all of them use Netty, and netty seems to not play very nice with differences even on minor and hotfix versions.Now i am testing with the newly release play 2.6 which has netty 4.0.x but since this version they shaded it, but i am still having issues when trying to use the nativeEpoll and including the dependency to redisson, I am still trying to figure out the cause, since the dependency is there but i still get.java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Method io.netty.channel.epoll.Native.recvFd0(I)I not found.I will be testing a few more things soon, but if anyone has observed anything like that using play 2.6, feel free to mention.

Redis timeout in AWS Lambda.Hi,We are trying to figure out the cause of an error we are seeing in our logs.  We are using AWS Lambdas and using a Redisson read write lock, with a lease time of 10 seconds.

Tomcat does not delete keys on Redis when session expires.Hello,I'm using Redisson with two Tomcat, each one in a virtual instance behind a Load Balancer on Azure, using Azure Redis PaaS as centralized database.Everything works great, both Tomcat can create and store session on Redis (I can easily see keys/values serialized on Redis) and both can retrieve the stored session correctly.My issue/question is: should Tomcat be able to delete keys automatically from Redis when the session expires? The sessionDestroyed() method on the SessionListener in correctly invoked, so I'm sure that Tomcat is destroying the session internally, but keys keep staying on Redis. I was assuming that Tomcat, through Redisson, whould be able to delete keys from Redis as well.Thanks.IP.

DNS monitoring in Replicated mode?Hi,I have a question regarding the DNS monitoring. Looks like the 'dnsMonitoring' can only be set when using single server config, but not in ReplicatedServersConfig. We are currently using AWS elasticache and we found in the AWS document, it highlights that "It is important that client applications are configured to frequently resolve DNS names of cache nodes when they attempt to connect to a cache node endpoint." So does redisson have the ability to detect potential ip changes on endpoints when using Elasticache?Based on my test, when I 'restored' an endpoint with the same host url but a different ip address, redisson kept using the last known ip address to try connect to that endpoint, but never detected the new one. I tried to change the ttl in java.security and it didn't help.Please let know if you have any ideas on this one. Thanks.
Latencies when Redis server is down.Hi,During our tests of redisson, we noticed that if the redis server is down, the latency is around 100ms, no matter what.This is problematic for our use case because it slows down too much and we would prefer a fast response/error.After carefully reading configuration options and experimenting with many tests, we could not find a solution.Do you have an idea of what could provoke this latency ?Below is a simplified code allowing to reproduce it (no need to launch a redis instance):

During the load testing got org.redisson.RedissonShutdownException: Redisson is shutdown , but there isn't  start() method to restart it again! 0.My application only use the Redisson lock/unlock feature as below:redissonClient.getFairLock(name).lockInterruptibly(expiredTime, timeUnit); redissonClient.getFairLock(name).unlock();Then I do load testing finally I got the un-recoverable errors as below:org.redisson.RedissonShutdownException: Redisson is shutdown.        at org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService.async(CommandAsyncService.java:477)        at org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService.evalAsync(CommandAsyncService.java:453)        at org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService.evalWriteAsync(CommandAsyncService.java:395)        at org.redisson.RedissonFairLock.tryLockInnerAsync(RedissonFairLock.java:126)        at org.redisson.RedissonLock.tryAcquireAsync(RedissonLock.java:172)        at org.redisson.RedissonLock.tryAcquire(RedissonLock.java:145)        at org.redisson.RedissonLock.lockInterruptibly(RedissonLock.java:114)So I post two issues:Issue 1: What does cause the Redisson shutdown without call redissonClient.shutdown() during testing.Issue 2: It need to provider below API when application encounter this error to restart its connections:redissonClient.start();or.redissonClient.restart();when encounter this error, but there isn't this method.
class 'LoadBalancerManager' in  version 2.10.1  may cause the NullpointException in method 'returnConnection'.i updated the version to 2.10.1 in my project.when i use redissonClient.getBucket("thekey").isExists(),some exception happen:the code connection.getRedisClient().getAddr().getAddress().getHostAddress() returns ip address, but the map ip2Entry need the key: ip + port.so null is returned.

NullPointerException is thrown during cache deletion.We encountered an issue during deleting cache while using RedissonKeys.delete after upgrade Redisson from 2.2.16 to 2.3.0. I have verified same issue with latest version 2.10.1 as well as 3.5.0.My unit test was very simple, the main thread keeps deleting 40 keys while another thread keeps setting the same.I am very curious why 2.2.16 does not have this issue. The only change I could find related to this is "switched from io.netty.util.concurrent.Future to org.redisson.api.RFuture".Well also surprisingly I could not find any same issue reported by anyone else.The exception information is like this:
RMapCache EntryListener events.I am testing the RMapCache listeners using redisson 2.10.0 release, when I executed the sample code from the wiki of distributed collections, the code is not executed.

Single connection sharing.Example context:When you have multiple client apps (near 1000) connecting to the same redis nodes and you don't want the redis nodes (or they can't) handle the amount of connections from all those client connections pools (file descriptors, etc).Besides of course, having small connection pools or having more redis nodes.Is there any plan or way to utilize redisson on a single shared connection model?Like for example other redis libraries does.
Bug/Feature-Request: Non-Expiry updating  boolean add(...)  in RSetCache.Hello,I am using RSetCache as a lock for various work item.If the item is in the Set, somebody is working on it. The worker that "locks" the item has a certain amount of time to finish the work, otherwise the "lock" on the item is removed and some other worker can try to claim the item.See.boolean org.redisson.api.RSetCache.add(Long value, long ttl, TimeUnit unit)Unfortunately, each call to add updates the expiry timestamp of the item, even if add was not successful  because it was already added.That means that, when the worker is killed/hangs/..., the work will never be picked up after the 5 minutes, because each try to reserve the item fails, but updates the expiry.It would be great to have an atomic method which:Only adds if new.Only sets expiry if added.Returns true if value was added.

Redisson 3.5.2 memory leak with pooled buffers.
[Feature enquiry] Redisson create throws exception when the redis cluster is not ready.I was wondering whether the presence of the redis cluster is must to instantiate the redisson client via Redisson.create(config)).I am evaluating the Redisson along with Jedis. I noticed that Jedis does not require the redis cluster to reachable when instantiating the client. However, redisson throws exception if there is no redis cluster exists.We have the use case where our service is started when redis is not available and we expect the redisson client to retry to connect to redis cluster by itself when it is asked to retrieve value.Could confirm whether this is supported feature or not?Sincerely,Peter.

Clean stale scheduled tasks.How properly remove stale tasks if my supervisor(who submits tasks) not gracefully exited - crashed.Workers(redisson nodes) see submited task, executes them and put result back to redis.

Is there a way to make a specific key locate on a specific redis instance in cluster mode?I want to make my multi-locks locate on different redis instances.I find out that redission can specify an instance to execute command on, but if the command is key-related, the instance specified will transmit the command to another instance.Can you give me some advice?
Spring Cache Too Many Eval Calls and not setting TTL on the keys.We are using redisson with spring cache and setting ttl on our keys. The problem is that we are not seeing any ttl being set on any key. Instead, I can see that some unnecessary keys are present in the redis database.Here is the result of "keys *" command:You can see that for a key "release", the redisson creates two more keys "redisson__timeout__set:{release}" and "redisson__idle__set:{release}". Also, there is no ttl present on key "release".My code is :We are using caching here:We are not using zset and eval commands. But, still the use of these calls are too high from redisson.Also, I have see that there are almost ~4M sortedSetTypeCommands on the redis cluster from redisson under our peak load which is degrading our performance.I want to know why redisson is not setting ttl on the key and managing it using sorted sets on the client side. It is not advisable to do it on the client side if the server automatically gives that feature.Is there any way to disable this ttl management from redisson so that it will just set that on the redis server and these calls are not fired.PS: We are using AWS elasticache redis server.Redisson version: 3.4.2.Redis Version: 3.2.4 with 1 master and 3 slaves.

Bogus map entries in RMapCache.Using version 3.5.0, we've noticed a very strange behavior in RMapCache map-iteration APIs (keySet,  entrySet, etc). It seems that the map sometimes contains "inverted" entries in which the key looks like a (bogus) instance produced by a value encoder, and the value looks like an (again) bogus instance produced by the key encoder*. When they do, these entries show alongside the normal entries. It's only because of Type Erasure that the code doesn't break until one actually calls an iterartion API: Because the original entries are still in place, get, put, etc. works as expected even when the map is in this broken state. We've managed to workaround this issue by using readAllKeys rather than keySet.We have a custom extremely type-aware jackson-based codec, which makes this bug very easy to spot.

Connection Count in Redis Servers increases when Failover happens.I am using redisson 2.8.2 with Java 1.7 and redis in Cluster mode. Recently we had an incident related to connection count of redis servers. After further investigation we have found that after each redis failover, connection count from each client to redis servers get increased and not going back to the earlier values. This happens after each failover in the redis servers whose role got change.Then eventually connection count reaches maximum connection count and application goes to a freeze state.

Redisson trying to connect to a dead slave on sentinel setup.Guys,I have a redis 3.2 setup with sentinel (3 nodes). I'm using redisson 2x.I'm performing some HA tests, dropping some slaves or making them fail to test the resilience of the system.My simple config:So I got this scenario where one of slaves is disconnected and with error on master link (check lines 10 and 33):sentinel slaves mymaster.The problem is that redisson tries to connect to this slave for reading regardless of its status instead of picking another slave.  Shouldn't redisson consider sentinel flags in this case? Maybe it is just a configuration I'm missing.
RReadWriteLock reentry is incompatible.This issue is related to #891.write lock for 10 seconds.write lock for 1 second.Now after 1 second the whole lock is released.

Configuring redisson to work with Azure Redis Cache standard tier.What's the correct way of setting redisson up to work against a standard tier Azure Redis Cache? I'm asking because the standard tier Redis Cache is replicated, but Azure doesn't provide the connection details for the slave instance.According to the documentation, Redisson's "replicated mode" requires that.All nodes (master and slaves) should be provided.So do I use "replicated mode" and only specify a single instance, or do I use "single instance mode"?

Reset maxIdleTime and ttl on read is not working.I am using redis with elastic cache in my spring application where i am using spring annotations for accessing cache.I need to reset cache idle time and ttl on read so that i can keep my user active until user goes idle beyond timeout.But read is not resetting the timeout and cache is evicted as per idle time and ttl set in configuration. Using below annotation in both the cases for creating and reading cache, the issue is same in both single and multiple server configuration.What is the configuration needed to reset idle time and ttl on read? please advise.

Redisson not set-up correctly when using JCache API and custom config file.I have a Spring Boot application and a Bean that implements org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.JCacheManagerCustomizer, i.e. there is a method that takes a javax.cache.CacheManager, and then follows the instructions provided here. Specifically, I have implemented a mixture of the code snippets for:"Using config file with custom location"."Using Redisson's config object:".Essentially, I have the following that does create caches as I would expect on my local Redis instance:@Override.However, when I run tests or start/stop the Spring boot application, I always receive the following Log message and the Redis caches are not cleared.  Note that the caches are reset if multiple tests are run in sequence but the data cached in the last test is still present in the Redis instance after the test has been run.After debugging, it seems that there is no org.redisson.Redisson object created. This appears to be caused by the checks for either a redisson-jcache.json and redisson-jcache.yaml being on the classpath in org.redisson.jcache.JCachingProvider#loadConfig(URI uri). If these files are not found, the config returned is null which means that org.redisson.jcache.JCachingProvider#getCacheManager(URI uri, ClassLoader classLoader, Properties properties) does not invoke the code inside the if conditional below:I do not have either a redisson-jcache.json and redisson-jcache.yaml file on the classpath since my team are trying to develop a way of loading different Redisson configuration files based upon the Spring Boot profile that is used to launch a Spring Boot application.  Configuration files are instead searched for in a specified location with a specified file name (the name of a Spring Boot profile).

Delayed writes.Hello,I was testing the behavior of Redis/Redisson when a network failure happens (say for few minutes) and then recovers. I observed the following un and wondering if there is a way to avoid this scenario.Observation:SADD command was issued at 14:46 PM and failed due to RedisTimeoutException. This seems to have happened just about when network failure just started.At 14:50 (A full 4 minutes later), it looks like Redisson heard back from Redis master node but due to client side timeout set, just skipped the response.Here are the logs:Redis Version:Redisson Version: 3.4.1.
useSentinelServers in ReadMode of MASTER_SLAVE, the master never got read.Tried following config.I wish both master and 2 slaves could be read (33% chance on RoundRobin algo). But I see the master never got read.Tried different Balancer and dug into the source, seems that the LB seems only be applied to slaves. The master server is setFreezed(true) and it won't get read unless both slaves get disconnected.Looks like ReadMode of "MASTER_SLAVE" is actually same as ReadMode of "SLAVE".

timeout configuration in Replicated Mode.Hi, i'm using redisson with a Replicated Mode configuration (1 master and 2 slaves).When attempting to debug an issue, i found that apparently the timeout configuration parameter is not being used in the implementation as documented.I was receiving a fair amount of unexpected RedisTimeoutException: Command execution timeout messages.Changing the retryAttempts and retryInterval allowed to circumvent the issue - but not changing timeout - which seemed odd to me, so i decided to dig further.In ReplicatedConnectionManager#L123,A value of 0 for retryAttempts, or even a higher number matched with a relatively low retryInterval always causes the RedissonClient instantiation to fail (due toCommand execution timeout).Raising these values can bypass the error on the initial connection and allow the instantiation.Still, the same applies to subsequent calls: they also won't also use the timeout provided in the configuration.Am i observing this correctly or is there something i'm missing here?
[Performance] Potential performance issue or improvement.One of our teams has been running some load tests that involve calling deleting keys from a redis cluster among other things. And when they run a profiler they observed that top hot spot was actually related to collection management (ConcurrentHashMap and HashSet) on redisson when getting connection info and copying it for every operation.As seen on the following hotspot analysis.This was tested with redisson 3.4.3, haven't tried with the latest one yet.Is there anything that could be changed from config or improved on the code in future versions?I believe the same scenario might show up on other operations besides delete.
SSL it's not fully implemented.Hi,I was trying to use your library with AWS Clustered mode and figured out it does not work with SSL.I figured out the problem and fixed it in my fork  but it's a hack what I did.Basically everywhere you create an address like "redis://" -- you need a way to know if it's SSL and put "rediss://" instead. Since those places have no access to config, unfortunately I changed all to force SSL everywhere.Do you have in plan a fix for this, or I can do it if you point me to the right way. I am trying to understand your logic and how can I be least invasive to pass a config. The simplest way would be to put a static public flag somewhere -- but that's also a hack I guess, and will only allow one type at one time, or pass a jvm property ...what do you suggest?Thanks in advance,Florin Moisa.

Redis timeout exceptions when trying to submit tasks on a now executor.I have a redisson configuration with a single worker executors for various schedules - 1min, 5min, 1hour, ... 24hours. When each of these ticker-tasks are invoked I have a set of devices on which I need to run diagnostics. Each device will have a task that will be slotted in various schedules and these tasks for all the devices that belong to a schedule need to be invoked at that particular time.The device tasks are put in a 'now' executor. So on every schedule invocation, there are a lot of tasks that are submitted on the now-executor.I am using Redisson version 3.3.1 and my key settings are:I am observing sporadic RedisTimeoutException when submitting tasks to the now executor:I am also getting sporadic timeouts on the ticker tasks - 1min, 3min etc.I have two instances running that feed off the Redis cache. These errors are sporadic in  nature. Appreciate any help in understanding the root cause of these timeouts.
Is there a way to get a value from a key that wasn't set using redisson?In my local redis database, I have a node.js app that sets redis keys and values. Can I use redisson to retrieve using the key name? Or can redisson only retrieve keys that were created by redisson?
Initialization timeouts leads to performance issues and timeout on batch.Hi,I've been fighting for the past week with some weird timeout issue on one of our apps.The use case is an RBatch operation that execute a bit of getBucket(..).getAsync()Run scenarios with 1 get or N gets as part of the batch and happens on any.The issue is basically that after a few minutes after starting the app, some instances of my app start displaying timeouts on that cache operation and thus becoming slow, then i restart that particular node of the app, and maybe it's fine forever, then I restart another instance and maybe now that one starts exhibiting the same problem. Sometimes it add a constant base of 50ms delay (due to timeout and retries) and sometimes it's 150ms or similar.We tried with redisson 3.2.0 and 3.5.5 and we can observe the problem on both, we though it might some hardware/network problem on those servers where such apps are running, but after restarting and re-running it works fine (or not) and viceversa on other servers.The errors we get on the failing app are always like this.And this what we observe many times.This is being used on a very high traffic app, but we can reproduce it with low traffic as well.Do you have any suggestion or insight on any thing we can try changing on our config and re-run our load test so we can sort out this issue. And we really need the data to be read from redis because the alternative when our cache fails is a much worse system that cannot handle the load or our SLA.We have been trying changes on the servers, running on different hardware, etc but nothing changed yet. Could it be some dead connection or bottleneck on the batch or connection manager that is causing this? Also as you can see on the avg time graph on top, it doesn't happen for every request, but for many of them, but constantly ONLY on that running app of all the total.

Snappy implementation in recent versions throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.Summary.Up to and including Redisson version 2.10.1 and 3.5.1, Redisson used the Xerial implementation of Snappy (https) for its SnappyCodec.In versions 2.10.2 and 3.5.2, Redisson was changed to use the internal implementation of Snappy from Netty instead. However, this implementation seems to be designed only for Netty's use cases and cannot encode moderately-sized payloads. In this case, moderately-sized means that payloads of more than 50,000 bytes are very likely to fail.This results in an error during the encoding step, e.g.Steps to Reproduce.I have created a repository that shows how and when this bug occurs. I take the last known good versions (2.10.1 and 3.5.1) and compare them with the most recent versions at the time of writing (2.10.5 and 3.5.4).See the repository here: https.To run the examples, either run the main method for each module in your IDE, or run each module via the command line with mvn package exec:java.The redisson-*-snappy-demo modules show the behavior in the indicated Redisson version. As you can see, the last known good versions (using the Xerial implementation of Snappy) can encode this payload without any problems, whereas the new versions (using the Netty implementation of Snappy) will fail.The netty-xerial-snappy-demo module shows how increasing the size of the encoded payload will soon cause Netty's implementation to reach a breaking point after which all attempts at encoding will fail. When creating the sample data with a random seed of 0, Netty will succeed on a payload of 44,895 bytes and fail on a payload of 44,896 bytes. Changing the seed will change this number, but it will generally fail somewhere between 40,000 to 50,000 bytes.The Xerial implementation, on the other hand, does not fail at any size I tested (up to 100 million bytes).Fix.While it's nice to avoid an additional dependency, I believe the Snappy implementation from Netty should probably be considered an internal implementation since this size limitation makes it unsuitable as a general compression algorithm.The Xerial implementation seems to be more widely used by more high-profile projects (e.g. Cassanda) and is probably a safer choice.
Seeing NullPointerExceptions with distributed services.We are testing the distributed services feature of redisson.

Connection distribution upon nodes.Hi,I have a setup of 3 redis nodes with 3 sentinel nodes.I am using latest redisson with master_slave read mode.I see that almost all connections go to the master redis and slaves are not in use.Also when connecting to redis i see only db0 is being in use.What am i doing wrong in my redisson config?Thanks.
OpenTracing support?Is there any current plans, third party plugins, or a recommended best practice approach to use Open Tracing with Redisson?In particular the remote service invocations seem like they could benefit from the tracing span context propagating across the service boundaries.I have done some quick googling and didn't find any libraries, documentation, or anything else on the subject.

Redisson Client hangs on creation.Hey guys,currently trying redis + redisson (v3.5.5), so this might be an easy question for some of you. Anyways as soon as I create my Redisson Client (config seems right), the client hangs in the create statement indefinitely without any exception or timeout, etc (waited for over an hour to hopefully see some error, sadly none).To the setup: Win10 + Ubuntu subsystem running redis on standard port (6379), single server setup. In its config the redis server is binding to 127.0.0.1 (also tried disabling protected mode). RedisDesktop Manager and Jedis connect just fine without any issues.Hope someone can help, as I couldn't find anything related to this anywhere online.Stacktrace :

Redisson not able to detect ip changes of active node in RLEC endpoint.We are currently using Redisson 3.5.0 to connect to our Redis labs enterprise cluster(RLEC). The driver is configured to connect using single server mode (as recommended for RLEC). When the active node ip switches/changes, Redisson is not able to reconnect with the new active node. It keeps retrying to communicate with the last known active node ip from the endpoint. This behavior is consistent with either "dns monitoring" being set to true / false.  If we manually set the same active node ip back, it immediately reconnects, which proves the point that its unaware of the ip address changes, unless the last known ip is elected again as active.How do we enable Redisson to detect potential ip changes of active node, while using endpoint of RLEC in single server mode?Please let me know if you have any ideas on this one. Thanks.
Eviction Scheduler doesn't remove expired keys from list.Hello,I asked a question on stackoverflow about how to well configure redisson to make eviction scheduler working on set in redis, but no answer yet :(.

Redisson is not reading the values set by external redis clients.I am creating a set through Medis, a Redis client or FastoRedis. When I try to read the same using redissonClient.getSet(key), I see an exception being thrown saying "Unable to evaluate the expression Method threw 'org.redisson.client.RedisException' exception." while debugging the set in IntelliJ. Why can't redisson is reading the value for the key? I noticed one thing when the redisson sets the value, it has quotes. But when you set a string from external clients, it doesn't have any quotes and redisson can't seems to be recognizing it.

Removing class name in serializing an object.Hi,I would like to minimize the data storage in Redis. When putting an Object in a list, I found that the object is serialized and stored in JSON. However, for every field in the json string, it has a class name info "java.lang.String" next a field for example.Looking at the source code, realized that this is added by default. Passing my object mapper to initialize won't work either.Is this necessary? Is there a way to disable this?Alternatively, I serialized myself an object into a string and put the string into RList. However, then it seems the library serialize one extra time as follow:
Redisson RMap get response is slow.I've a java application where I'm using Rmap to store and retrieve objects to/from Redis. The response time of map.put(...) is reasonable but map.get(...) is averaging 4000000.0 ns.  I'm using FstCodec for serialization/deserialization. The application has many classes that do not provide no arg constructor and hence certain codecs can't be used.I would like to know how to improve the map.get(...) response.

Reading from Elasticache replica nodes.Hello.I'm using Redisson ( redisson-all-3.5.5.jar )to connect to AWS Elasticache running in Cluster mode disabled. The cluster has 1 primary and 2 replica nodes.  The application uses Redisson's Spring Cache abstraction support.I have configured Redisson in Master-Slave mode providing the primary end-point as master and replica end-points as slaves.I load the application by making hundreds of simultaneous requests hitting the cache.When I view CloudWatch metrics, I notice that there are no CacheHits for the replica nodes. All the requests seem to be going only to the master/primary node.I have tried SLAVE as well as MASTER-SLAVE for read-mode attribute. I played around with the LoadBalancer class trying out RoundRobin and Random , but to no luck.The idea behind using multiple replicas was to distribute read load and not just for high-availability. It is important for us to read from slave nodes. Is there some setting that needs to be enabled to allow Redisson to read from slave nodes ?

Two threads can acquire the same lock with redis cluster.I have a very simple try-finally block something like this:I have a redis cluster 4.x with 3 masters and 3 slaves, redisson is initialized like this:In most cases it work, but sometimes I can see it from the log that the lock cannot block two threads T1 and T2 can acquire the lock simultaneously, then one of them can release the lock successfully, the other one will throw an exception:So, my questions is that, why two threads can acquire the same lock?

BitMap (RBitSet) questions.I have two questions.Are there any plans to extend RBitSet index range beyond Integer.MAX_VALUE*2?

See e.g.  When do we plan to having a roaring bitmap implementation - be it PRO or community version of Redisson.

Is there anyway RMapCache can work with other clients?Our service (Python) shares a redis with some other Java services. We and some Java service put in the data, and another Java service consumes the stored data.Java services have decided to use redisson RMapCache to store and read the data. And since they both use redisson so there is no issue for them.But I found if RMapCache can not get the data I hset in redis via redis python client.It complains that:I suppose the data I put didn't follow the RMapCache eviction scheduler data format.Is there any workaround for this? Or any suggestions on this situation?

Using RMapCache what combination of ttl & idleTimeout can I use to expire field that is read < those values.I have a scenario where I have a field that I want to keep as long it the field value is updated at a rate < the idleTime, and expire when the that is not the case.What appears to be happening is that as the field is read more frequently than the idleTime, and when a get is performed it updates the idleTime expiration, so that the field is never expired.I tried the following combinations:but none of those combinations work.  Is it even possible?thanks, Mitchell.

RLock reentrant behaviour over unlock.This might be a trivial case/question but according to java specs, a reentrant lock can be acquired  by the owner thread infinite number of times and simple can be unlocked completely with just one unlock call.What I'm seeing is the opposite of it currently, in RLock implementation. It behaves like a semaphore rather than a reentrant lock. Every unlock call decreases reentrant counter on Redis and in order to unlock it completely, I have to call unlock until the counter hits to zero. Is this the expected behaviour?

Redisson RBucket codec problem!  java  object is Serializable or not makes putting obj to redis failed! ·.I use redisson 2.8.1, as default it use jackson JSON codec, but once I want to store a class ( which implements java.io.Serializable , it's - org.apache.shiro.session.mgt.SimpleSession ) in a RBucket, it failed to store the every object filed value in redis master slave (sentinel mode ) cluster. That means, I lose some value of the Object stored in redis.... it is dark..Then I tried to use other codec:Tested OK! a class ( which implements java.io.Serializable) object can be sotred correctly and get from redis using RBucket.  But, we have another problem here : a class ( which not implements java.io.Serializable) cannot be stored in redis now.... dark again...Could I beg your suggestion? Thanks very much .

[Question] Use Rmap as a data member on a singleton or create a new instance for every call ·.If our server handles lots of Rest calls that access distributed collections, is it safe to keep a single instance of Rmap as a data member on a Singleton bean (and have multiple threads use it concurrently) or is it better to create a new instance of Rmap for every call?We're not using a local cache, so there's no data supposed to be kept in the Rmap instance, but does it have any concurrency limits we should be aware of?Is there a significant overhead associated with creating a new instance of Rmap for every call?

Reddison Spring Cache modifies exception semantics of annotated method ·.Regarding spring javadoc the spring Cache interface demands implementations to throw a Cache.ValueRetrievalException."Wrapper exception to be thrown from get(Object, Callable) in case of the value loader callback failing with an exception.".The reddision cache implementations breaks this contract and throws a ValueRetrievalException that is wrapped within an IllegalStateException. This exception is not handled by Springs CacheAspectSupport and thus thrown back directly to the caller of the annotated method.Looking at CacheAspectSupport, it would also expect a CacheOperationInvoker.ThrowableWrapper as cause of the ValueRetrievalException which is removed within the reddison cache implementation when constructing the ValueRetrievalException.This behaviour breaks the transparency of the cache abstraction and beaks code that relies on exceptions for control flow (eg. javax.ws.rs.NotFoundException). Can you please take a look and this and tell me if that is intended behaviour?Best Regards.Daniel Selinger.

It usually means the last handler in the pipeline did not handle the exception.io.netty.handler.codec.DecoderException: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unexpected character ('b' (code 98)): Expected space separating root-level values.Any hints?Client Factory.
ZREVRANGEBYLEX not supported by redisson ·.@mrniko Currently ZREVRANGEBYLEX is not supported by redisson which can pull details in reverse order of the stored values on a key LEX sorted set data structure. Please support this function as soon as possible as we would like to use it. Without that the retrieval of data in reverse order is very cumbersome and not an easy way out. Even LUA script based on discussion with REDIS labs, they say it fecthes data only from one shard and cannot go and look for data in other shards... We want to use this function zrevrangebylex in redis batch execute to retrieve data from multiple sorted set keys at once.

"You can't write against a read only slave" after failover with sentinel·.Hello, I have a strange issue with redisson and sentinel fail-over.I have a SpringBoot application, I have multiple instance of this application, load balanced(HAproxy).My http sessions is shared between these instances with Spring-session and Redisson.I have a Redis cluster in "Master - Slave" configuration with 6 sentinel.When I have a failure on my Redis master (I can reproduce with "redis-cli -p 6379 DEBUG sleep 30"), the sentinel fail-over is working well (in around 2 minutes) and the slave become a master.This is the beginning of my problems :First I can see many "org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException"  during 10-15 minutes.I assume, it's probably due to connection switching.But after during 1 hour, I still have lot of "org.redisson.client.RedisException".Lot of user login in my application are failing and all the access to redis become slow become slow (jump from 2 ms to 100ms)And I restarted my Spring Boot application and everything is back to normal.Do you have experienced similar issue ? or any hint ?I'm using SpringBoot 1.5.8.RELEASE.Redisson 3.5.4.Spring Session 1.3.1.RELEASE.
Slow gets from redisson in CommandServiceAsyncGet.Hi,We are using redisson-client 3.6.0 with cluster mode enabled with elasticache, redis=3.2.6(encryption-at-rest enabled). These are the configurations for 2 separate clusters,We see a degraded performance on all our apis and the bottle-neck seems to be from redisson. We are using spring caching and noticed that all the keys with a particular cacheName are being stored in a single shard instead of being distributed. How do we solve for actually distributing this across different shards?We are contemplating switching to redisson.pro if it's going to help. But does the configuration look good and will redisson.pro help with the issues?Please find attached screenshots that is showing the bottle-neck.
NPE with redisson pro.I am using redisson pro trial version(3.6.0) in cluster config with elasticache(redis=3.2.6), I see NPE in get and evict operations using spring cache framework. I don't see this issue with the community version(3.6.0) and same configuration.It basically just gives this error and hangs. I think the exception is being swallowed by DefaultPromise.

Redissonspringlocalcache manager in distributed systems.Hi I have read about the redissonspringlocalcache manager that it is keeping a local cache backed by redis. Please correct me if I am wrong. Please tell me how it works in distributed mode.Eg. If we have 10 ec2 instances deployed connecting to same redis. Suppose there is a case which has been invalidated by one machine. How early can the other 9 machines would be knowing that their local cache is invalid and they need to call the redis to update it.Do it use background polling to check if it is enabled.?
RedissonSpringLocalCachedCacheManager not found.I want to use RedissonSpringLocalCachedCacheManager  for spring cache.But I can not find RedissonSpringLocalCachedCacheManager and LocalCachedCacheConfig in redisson 3.6.0 version. Is something wrong?

Sentinel failover with pub/sub failure ·.Guys,I'm facing na issue I'd like to share and get insights from you.We run a sentinel cluster which is composed by (3 sentinels, 1 master and 2 slaves). The application can have dozens of instances and is connected to to this cluster via redisson 2.10.7 and redis 3.2.10.Eventually in an event of failover pub/sub messages seems to not be delivered to redisson clients (I say that because SentinelConnectionManager logs for failover are not present in system logs).The only log after that is:After that, redisson becomes irresponsive and seems to never recover and the only way to fix it is to restart the application node.Redis cluster is confirmed to be working properly (as restart of application nodes alone fixes the issue)According to redis client guideline pub/sub messages are not guaranteed to be delivery and should not replace the pooling mechanism to check the cluster status.  I need to dig a little bit into the redisson code but it seems to strongly rely on pub/sub only.I'm trying to reproduce it locally and build a test case, but it is being tricky.Have you ever experienced this problem before?redisson config as follows:
Add support of PING for Pub/Sub.Add support of PING for pub/sub channels.redis/redis@70e3948.Discussion about this Redis feature: redis/redis#420.
Redisson issuing undue commands with spring cache.We are using redisson 3.5.2 with spring cache.When I put the debug on the method,I get the following requests when using Monitor on the redis server.I am unable to understand why the eval and hset command is sent from redisson when I am getting a key.This is creating an issue for us to scale our services since these eval and hset calls will only go to master. Even if, we increase our redis slaves we wont be able to scale our reads since each read results into two writes to redis master.Other issues are:The eval command is taking a lock on redis master.The hset command is setting the same response in redis master which is being replicated by all the redis slaves. This is resulting in wastage of redis server resources since they are wasting them to replicate the exact same data.
Redisson 2.9.1 Redis 2.8.17 in sentinel mode, redisson subscriber is not self-healing after restarting all redis boxes·.Set Up.Redisson version: 2.9.1.Redis Version: 2.8.17  Mode: Sentinel.Found this issue in our production, not sure if self-healing is supported by redisson during disaster like all redis servers are down, if it is supported, any specific version ?We initialize the subscriber once as following during server startup.Redisson 2.2.27 is performing better than 2.9.1 in the sense of re-subscribe.Even all Client in 2.9.1 version, sharing the same config as above, some clients are able to re-subscribe.I went through the implementation of 2.9.1, found out that if following Scenario B, while doing MasterSlaveEntry. reattachPubSubListeners(), the unsubscribe and resubscribe process is trying in best-effort, which is prone to lose listener for a channel, leading clients unable to resubscribe. What is confusing is in Scenario A, some of the clients were able to reconnect somehow.Is there any way for redisson to survive a redis disaster failure like this ?
Multimap tries to keep the List/Set on the same node, but ignores Key Hash Tags in the given Key.As I described in the title, I am trying to utilize Key Hash Tags to accumulate data on the same ClusterNode.I am using a Multimap and noticed the Key for the Lists/Sets are wrapped in the Key Hash Tags and so they may be placed on another Node.For example:The MultiMap key is "{multi.map}.some.key".An entry in it would be saved in the List/Set "{{multi.map}.some.key}:ADJ...".So the Hash is not "multi.map" but rather "{multi.map".For further information see the "Key Hash Tag" section on.
Redisson Remote Service stops responding.We have an RMI running on Redission 3.5.7.  Each RMI is fire-and-forget with no ack or completion time.This particular RMI is invoked about once every 2 minutes.  After about 3 days, the server side of the RMI simply stops processing.  The client is still producing messages.  Other Redis features such as client caches seem to still be working correctly on the same APP that is supposed to be processing the RMI calls.1-2 minutes after the last processed RMI call on the server side, we get the warning below.  This is the only error or warning that we are getting.  The rest of the java application works fine.  Once the the java application is restarted, all the remote calls are processed as expected.We are running Redis on AWS with Redis 3.2.4 in cluster mode.
Multiple JVMs tryLock attempt.We have a spring application running in 3 different servers/jvms. Those services receives an event notification with an eventID.In order to avoid event processing duplication we are trying to use redis lock, to process only one event each time. We have multiple requests with same eventID coming from other services, so this is a very common scenario.The lock is centralized in one Spring Bean.Each time an event comes we first verify if we can lock.We also the singleServer approach (commented above). But in both scenarios events are processed twice, eventually.We don´t understand what its wrong. Can someone give us a clue?
RedissonLocalCachedMap does not broadcast LocalCachedMapClear on clear()clear() method is implemented properly on RedissonMap; but it is not overridden on RedissonLocalCachedMap. RedissonLocalCachedMap should override the parent implementation by clearing the local cache, clearing the Redis map, and broadcasting a LocalCachedMapClear event on the invalidationTopic.
RExecutorService - Task resume on another worker doesn't happen, when worker(redisson node) goes down.Problem:We are evaluating Redisson as a distributed task queue manager and as a result the expected behaviour for failure scenario is:-- If a worker starts working on a task and if worker goes down before completing the task then task should be resumed on another worker.As per our observation this doesn't happen.For SIGINT and SIGQUIT signal - Most of the times it finished the running tasks. (We found couple of instances where it didn't happen)For SIGKILL (when worker is killed using kill -9), executing tasks are lost.Can you please help us understanding that is the above mentioned 'expected behaviour' correct? Does redisson provide this guarantee? If yes are we missing some configuration? If no, please indicate what is the best practice for using Redisson in this case?Here is the code of the the Task:Here is the main code which is invoking it:Commands with which I start two Redisson Nodes are:Please let me know if any more details are needed.
JsonJacksonCodec cannot deserialize EnumMap.Hi,I opened a ticket on the jackson databind project but I think this issue could use some visibility here.FasterXML/jackson-databind#1932.The code below can replicate the exception I am seeing.

Support for dnsMonitoring in Sentinel Setup · Issue #1299.After the fix of #1280 which improved greatly the resilience of Sentinel setup, it would be great to have dnsMonitoring  feature as well because in failover scenarios of sentinels instances, the box can get a different IP and the current implementation caches the dns resolution forever.  It means it never reconnects to new sentinels in the cluster.
Error while creating bean of RScheduledExecutorService.I am trying to create a singleton bean of RScheduledExecutorService in Spring 4. I have not yet autowired this bean anywhere. I am always ending up with error. I am working with Redisson 2.11.Unable to find any kind of solution or any instances of problem with anyone else here. Is this a bug ?Since it is a JsonMappingException I also tried using different codes but nothing helped.
Performance issues with updateMode=AFTER_REQUEST.We are trying to use updateMode=AFTER_REQUEST to make sure all the session data will be saved into Redis server. After reviewing the source code, looks it may cause performance issues since we keep a lot of data in the session, and store function will be called on every request no matter there is session changes or not.Is it possible put save session data to Redis after tomcat request code to a separate thread?
RedisClient does not override 'hashcode and equals' may cause  redis connections are not closed properly.I found that in master-slave mode, the redis connections on slave servers may not get closed properly.Caused by: org.redisson.client.RedisException: ERR max number of clients reached.After reading the source code, I found that the reason is that RedisClient does not override hashcode and equals.Consider the following situation:One hostname slave-hostname maps to two ip-addresses: ip1, ip2.Firstly, slave-hostname  maps to ip1, client2Entry will cache new RedisClient and ClientConnectionsEntry instances: RedisClient-ip1 and ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1.DNS  changes from ip1 to ip2, all the connections of ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1 were closed properly.DNS  changes from ip2 to ip1, client2Entry will cache another RedisClient and ClientConnectionsEntry instances: RedisClient-ip1-1 and ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1-1. RedisClient-ip1-1 was different from RedisClient-ip1 as they were not the same instance.DNS  changes from ip1 to ip2 again,All the connections of ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1-1 should get closed properly.  When san client2Entry values, it is possible to find ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1 or ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1-1.The connections of ClientConnectionsEntry-ip1-1 may not get closed properly.Our master-slave model.two slave servers, with one slave hostname, DNS changes every twenty seconds.

Tomcat Session Manager issue to renew session in Load Balance environment.Hi!I'm using Redisson 3.6.0 with redisson-tomcat 3.5.6 with:Elasticache Redis Cluster.Spring App deployed on two instances EC2 Tomcat (instance 1 and instance 2)Load Balance with non-sticky session.My session timeout is configured to 30min.The steps to reproduce the issue:a. User logged in on instance 1 (a new session is created with timeout of 30 min);b. After 15 min, an ajax request was made by the application which was managed by 'instance 2' refreshing the session to more 30min;c. After more 20min the user reload the page, and the load  balance send some requests to 'instance1' and to 'instance 2', but the instance 1 has been idle  for 35minutes and because of that, delete the session that was renewed 20 min ago!This issue is only reproducible using at least two instances behind a load balance with non-sticky session because the action to delete the session ignores if the session was renewed by other instances.Is there anything I can do to prevent this behavior?I think this is related with #972.
is it possible to add a duplicate check when RedisPubsubConnection addListener ?Sorry to open so many issues for the same problem, feel free to close it if you think this is not appropriate.We are trying to have the best availability of our service when redis servers in Sentinel mode run into disaster situations (like all redis-server, redis-sentinel are down)Currently, what we are trying is when Redisson client last received ping is too old, it will try to re-subscribe to the same channel. However, this introduced new problems, when the QPS is high, we added multiple listeners for the same client to the same channel, which is not optimal.In following two places, there is no duplicate check (if the listener already in the PubsubConnection, don't add the listener)Is it possible to add a duplicate check that only when the listener is not there, we add the listener to the connection ?

Configurable Tomcat Session Key Prefix for Redis.RedissonSessionManager uses "redisson_tomcat_session:"  as key prefix, so if multiple tomcat instances are using same "redis" server for storing session data. So need a mechanism to configure default key prefix.
calling getMap() million times creates millions of map instances.While reading the Redisson tutorial and examples, I am under the impression that I need to always call redisson.getMap() in order to get the latest data from the cache . Right ?I have a storm bolt which calls getmap(key) for millions of incoming records.Looks like millions of instances of RedisonMap being created , leading to pressure on GC.

Old/stale nodes not removed from NodesGroup.When trying to implement a healthcheck for a Redis Cluster I'm using code similar to the below to get the list of nodes and ping them to see if they're up.If I redeploy a node and it gets a new IP, the new node is returned by redisson.getNodesGroup(); but the old one remains and we get an error:If I failover a slave node then the slave node will be returned by redisson.getNodesGroup(); as a master (which is correct) but the original master will appear twice as both a master and a slave. If I then failover back to the original master, that node will be returned as a master twice and still as a slave.When digging into the code it looks like this list/map lives in MasterSlaveConnectionManager as clientEntries which only gets cleared or removed from during a shutdown.What I'd expect is for old or stale nodes to be cleared up from this list/map.
Slow down when Redis master switching (sentinel)Hi,We have detect an issue on our redis (sentinel) cluster when there is a redis master switching .During a performance test, we use PriorityQueue (~ 10 calls / seconds). All transaction are closed on 20-50 milli-seconds.When master switching, on JConsole we have seen Redisson place some locks on redis databases, and all application are slow down... All transaction are closed on 3-10 seconds !On our Redis cluster we have, 1 master, 5 slaves.This is our using components versions :Also, we have test, redisson 2.11.1, we have the same issue.We have issue with this config :And we have apply a fix (work around), it's better running, but it's a huge configuration (on system : lot of connection and open file issue)Can you help us please ?Thanks you.
RedLock Java ambiguous implementation.Hi,we should implement a distributed lock system for our clustered Spring Boot application.We have a Redis "cluster" (no cluster mode enabled) with Sentinel.Now, reading the documentation it seems that RedissonRedLock should be used as locks wrapper class to use lock/unlock api.It seems that RedissonRedLock should be used with different RedissonInstance e multiple RLock's.But what kind of lock should we use to implement single distributed lock with single redisson instance per-node?

Consecutive "Subscribe timeout" for topics utilizing same AsyncSemaphore lock.Hi there,Thanks for the quick fix on the ticket #1268 . We tested it and the block on RedissonTopic.removeAllListeners no longer happened.However, we started see another issue: After a fairly long time running with the new code, subscriptions( by calling RedissonTopic.addListener) to the topics which are assigned to the same AsyncSemaphore lock from the method MasterSlaveConnectionManager.getSemaphore() are all encountering the same timeout error like "Subscribe timeout 9500ms". It's very consistent. But for other subscription calls to other topics which assigned to different AsyncSemaphore locks, everything works fine.It's possibly related to #1268. Please help advice how to tune and debug this problem.Thanks.

RSet returned by RSetMultimap.get() does not update multimap correctly.RSets returned by get() cannot be used to populate RSetMultimap. Multimap key and size information is not managed properly despite get() returning populated sets. See this example:Here, multimap1 keyset and keysize are not initialized. Javadoc for the get() method claims:"Changes to the returned collection will update the underlying multimap, and vice versa.".
What is difference between Rmap and RLocalCachedMap.I have a DB with 100k hashmap. And I run some 10k, 100k loop test to compare time between getting by RMap and getting by RmapCached.I saw no differences in benchmark time. Am i make a wrong config or something.When I use RMapLocalCached, why redisson keep getting result from my Redis DB, I think it should get result from some local variable instead of connecting to Redis DB and get result ?I use LocalCachedMapOptions.defaults().cacheSize(0).timeToLive(100000) .evictionPolicy(LocalCachedMapOptions.EvictionPolicy.NONE) .syncStrategy(LocalCachedMapOptions.SyncStrategy.NONE) .reconnectionStrategy(LocalCachedMapOptions.ReconnectionStrategy.NONE),But when i change a value in Redis DB by redis-cli, redisson immediately get a changed value. ?Thanks.
Unhandled DecoderExceptions deplete Netty pool.Our web application is writing an object using Redisson 3.6.4 (Jackson codec) which Jackson cannot deserialise for whatever reason. On attempting to read the object, Redisson fails on the first few attempts and throws a DecoderException as expected. However, the following message is seen from Netty:Apr 06, 2018 11:54:28 AM io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline onUnhandledInboundException.After a few attempts (depending on size of Redisson connection pool), all connections are depleted. At this point Redisson is unable to execute any more commands regardless of validity.I have created a barebones test case to demonstrate the problem:You can checkout and run with ./gradle run (assuming Redis is running locally). See how the first few read attempts fail immediately, but the thrown execption changes from RedisException to RedisTimeoutException and the RedissonClient cannot execute any more commands.
Why no RMapCacheAsync::fastReplace?I am trying to optimize my Redisson throughput, and to do so, am using the MapCache fast methods, where no result is returned for a put or remove, but there is no fastReplace.  Why so?I created my own one by subclassing RedissonMapCache and adding a method there, and that works fine.  However, now I want to use pipelining, but it will not work with the Batch classes without further modification.I do see that there is a replaceOperationAsync, which returns a Boolean, so keeps the response message to a minimum, but that is offset by essentially doubling the size of the request by including the value to be replaced, so that is less than ideal for my purposes.

RMI starts to lose ability to send commands.We are using Redisson 3.6.4 and publishing several hundred RMIs at a time.  After a few minutes, we start seeing these errors, and they start to build up over time, until no RMIs are being processed at all.We are on a clustered AWS Redis server.

Frequent timeout with RedisLabs multi-proxy setup.In the latest Redislabs cluster, the user can enable multiple proxies, and the DNS query of the cluster would return different IP addresses for load balancing.From Redisson side, we observe Redisson would have very frequent timeout with DNS monitoring enabled. Seems like for each DNS lookup, if IP address changes, Redisson would try to reconnect with this new IP and lead to unstable system.Is it possible for Redisson to check the cluster health before trying to connect to the new IP address?

Redisson: Why reactive client doesn't have PermitExpirableSemaphore?Note: Asked same question here in StackOverflow, but there was no response.I am using redisson reactive Java client. In non reactive client one could get expirable Semaphore as:-.RPermitExpirableSemaphore semaphore = redisson.getPermitExpirableSemaphore("mySemaphore");But If I create a reactive client, I can only find redisson.getSemaphore("value") function. I need PermitExpirableSemaphore because:-.I need a lock, that could be released by different thread(so can't use RLock).I need a lease timeout to prevent deadlock in case the lock aquiring thread is killed or stuck.Is there any way to achieve this behavior in Redisson?I can set lease time global in Config as:- Config().setLockWatchdogTimeout(leaseTimeMs), but I really need different leasetime at different locks.
Introduce BatchOptions object.Currently Batch settings exposed as RBatch method which is not convenient and contradicts common API design.
RMI Garbage Collection in Redis.Each of the RMIs seems to be put in a namespace under {redisson_rs}  How are RMIs being garbage collected or do we need to run another process to do our own garbage collection for RMIs?We are using 3.6.5 on a Redis cluster at Amazon.What we appear to be seeing is that the RMI jobs are never purged from the DB.  Most of our RMIs are set and forget.Our code generally looks something like this:The server code.The client code.What we are seeing.The specific key/value pairs for the RMI seem to grow unbounded, until Redis runs out of memory to process more jobs.  We have been looking for someway to delete the job once it has been completed, but are not sure how to do this.
'reconnectionTimeout' setting in unavailable. Please use 'failedSlaveReconnectionInterval' setting instead!use Version 3.6.5.
PermitExpirableSemaphore to be able to make expirable permit to a normal permit.Once a permit is acquired as an expirable permit, there should be a way to remove the expiry and make it to a normal permit.

Publish a request id in a redis event.This is a feature request.It's not always easy to associate a redis event with a specific request, e.g., when you don't know whether a put would result in a CREATED or UPDATED event.

Tomcat Session replication inconsistences.Hi,I have a tomcat cluster with 2 servers, both having the Redisson Session manager for non-sticky session replication. Whenever a request is served for the first time by a server, a new session is created with session attributes. Next time if the second server receives a request with same session id, it should create a session in memory and fetch the attributes from Redis. Sometimes it does fetch all the attributes and sometimes it does not. This random behaviour is really getting annoying.I've tried to use REDIS as the read mode instead of MEMORY. But the application gave me some problems(IllegalMonitorStateException). That's why I was not able to test it.After looking at the code, I've seen one problem. If we are using the MEMORY read mode and all instances have the same session with all the attributes; whenever an instance updates an attribute it will be persisted on Redis but the other instances won't check this update if they already have a value stored in memory for that session. This is obviously discouraging.I am wrong about my findings? And how can I solve my problem?Thanks in advance.

RedissonBoundedQueue expiration seems odd.Could someone help me to understand how expiration works with queue.I found several expire method seems like they working fine, but after expiration it needs to initiate queue with trySetCapacity because it is not possible to add element there.Also i found that expire works not per element, it sets for whole queue which i also don't understand, so there could be some strange things if i will set expire for 10 seconds and after will try to set for 20 seconds,  every element will be expired after 20 seconds.I don't say that is a bug i just want to get proper information about expiration in queues.Thanks for every answers.

Feature request - I would like the ability to specify redis channel name.Currently, when subscribing an application to redis events, via adding a listener, there's no easy way to specify a channel name.  The problem with this is that in a clustered environment, where each member of the cluster is responsible for updating the same redis keys, e.g., session keys, then all members of the cluster will receive all notifications for all the updates, even if they are only interested in the updates that they made.One way to get around this is to specify a unique channel name for each member of the cluster, resulting in only being notified of the updates that it is responsible for.I have been able to achieve this by subclassing the Redisson class, in my case the RedissonMapCache, and overloading the channel naming methods.  I've demonstrated that this works.  One problem with this is that without additional modifications or extensions to Redisson, it won't work with batching.  Ideally, if one could provide a mechanism for modifying the channel name, that would be great.thanks, Mitchell.

Spring cache not expired properly.Spring Cache should expire with given TTL making it footprint stay at the same level.Spring Cache footprint constantly grows.Steps to reproduce or test case.The Spring Cache data items seem not to be evicted by Redisson if other keys in the same hash are accessed before in periods lower than Spring Cache expiration time, even if this access is performed for different data items.E.g. imagine a case where there is a Spring Cache region named "test-cache" with TTL of 5 minutes.That leads to a problem of uncontrollable cache grows, as the cache is almost 100% guaranteed to be accessed in the period if individual item's TTL (see screenshot):You can see non-expiring Spring Cache in the following redis-cli output (it is production instance output, so no "test-cache" there, but check "ContentService.findAllByContentGroupOrdered" instead that has grown to 27256 members - should be around 100 in a normal case):Sampled 33 keys in the keyspace!

Cannot Read Avro encoded Object from Redis after changing Java Class.I don't know if that's the way it works, but I was expecting that I'm able to add a new field to a class, and the deserialization from Redis would be Backward compatible with the "old" schema for the class.The  is that the Read operation from Redis (RBucket) explodes, with all kind of deserialization/parsing errors, depending on the type of the new field. But it breaks always.Steps to reproduce or test case.I just created a simple Java Class. Then I initialize the codec for my redisson client in this way:and I'm able to write and read my object instances from Redis. But After I add a new attribute to my Java Class, then I'm not able to read my saved objects anymore. If I remove the field, then everything starts working again.singleServerconfig.
Invalidated session in one tomcat is still used in another tomcat instance when relogin.Hello,I am using redisson tomcat session manager in docker environment. I have 2 tomcat containers and want to share the sessions with redis. I can see the sessions information are stored and retrieved on redis.However, I have an issue that an invalidated session is used because the invalidation is done in another tomcat. The steps that I've done is:Login request goes to tomcat1 and a session is created.Any request after login (e.g. query) goes to tomcat2. The same session is used, and it works fine.Logout request goes to tomcat1 and the session is invalidated.Try to re-login and the request goes to tomcat2 and it gets a session.The problem occurs here. When a request done after re-login, it goes to tomcat1, but the session is not there, and my application throws an error.I have debugged through the code and I found that:When the first login request is done in tomcat1, the getSession method is called and findSession method will not find any sessions, therefore a new session is created in the memory of tomcat1 and stored to redis.When a request (e.g. query) goes to tomcat2, the findSession method will look into the tomcat2 memory first, and if it could not find it, it will find the session info in redis, and then create a new session object in the tomcat2 memory and put the session information from redis into it. (Correct me if I'm wrong)When logout, it goes to tomcat1, the session is invalidated, it is removed from the tomcat1 memory and also the session info is removed from the redis. This means the session in tomcat2 memory is never removed at this point. (Again, correct me if I'm wrong)Therefore when re-login request goes to tomcat2, because findSession method will get the session from the memory first, and the client still has the same session id, it will get the session from tomcat2 memory which has already been invalidated in tomcat1 and used it in the request without updating to redis.Finally after re-logged in, when trying to make a request and it goes to tomcat1, the session does not exist because the findSession could not find the session neither in tomcat1 memory nor the redis. Therefore the application will throw an error because it checks first if the session exists before making a query request.My question is what behaviour do you expect in this case? Is the findSession method already working as expected?Or do I miss something in my application? (e.g. do I have to always check the "session:isValid" should be true everytime I do login? (because it's not described in the documentation usage guide))Thanks.Regards,Ricky.

Incorrect results from RBitSet.setAsync.I believe the issue is in RedisCommands SETBIT_TRUE and SETBIT_FALSE that use BitSetReplayConvertor that, by the look of it, is implemented to return true if Redis sends back the same value as was passed to SETBIT.

RedissonRedLock algrithm improvement.Imagine you have 5 masters, when a client has managed to acquire 3 locks, based on the RedLock algorithm it is deemed to be a winner, hence he can carries on the logic after the lock, however when a network partition happened, he lost one lock. Other clients will then able to acquire a majority.By making failedLocksLimit configurable, the decision on how much risk he is willing to take to use the lock is on the user himself. In some cases he may want N/2 + 2 or +3 etc., to be a valid minimum requirement.

Redisson in cluster environment cannot use the same node when iterating a set.When I try to iterate a set collection in the cluster environment, I'm getting some odd result: some entries are missing.

So the Redisson can execute sscan command from alternative two slave nodes.I turn on the debug logging, I notice that Redisson has changed connection during each command execution with default load balance strategy.detail logs like this:So I simply trace the source code,In the class BaseIterator, it could store the current query connection correctly with a field.protected RedisClient client;Then, it passes the client info to the function async of the class CommandAsyncService , which the parameter source contains it.The most disturbing part is this:When trying to get a connection from MasterSlaveConnectionManager connectionReadOp, it will not consist with the previous client connection, but to get a new slave connection according to the master-slave entry. So this will get a different connection than the last.like this:At last, here is briefly my test code.Hope to make sense, thanks~.

This is the commit that I believe caused this behavior. fe98d0a#diff-bb90b8f5c06abce59014861b02cecd93.It seems the issue is the hashcodes are different only when making the INFO call (That i know of) because the channels value changes.So when doing the get for client2key, it gets nothing. For Writes and reads that i tried, the hashcodes for the clients are the same.Steps to reproduce or test case.Spin up any redis cluster and simply call .info() on a node in the .getNodesGroup()Redisson configuration.default redis cluster config with 7 nodes in the cluster. 3 Master and 4 Slave.
Cluster Mode: Master fails over to slave, when slave fails over again redisson client retains connection to previous dead node.Redisson is able to send read and write commands to the 2nd newly elected Master.This is the topology:When testing various failover situations, I ran into a situation which causes the redisson client to get stuck using a bad connection when making the write calls, however the thread that is polling for the topology is fine. The situation is the redis process dies on a Master node I am writing to, a slave is then promoted to master. The redisson client is still in a GOOD state. The redis process dies on the new Master, a floating slave is then promoted to Master. At this point, the redisson client is now STUCK using a bad connection to a dead master.Steps to reproduce or test case.Run 7 node cluster, I believe this is the minimum to reproduce this as you need an extra floating slave to promote after the first Master/Slave pair dies. For Master 1 slots 0-5460 (M1), kill the redis process. This should cause it's slave (S1) to promote to master and the floating slave (FS2) to attach to this new master. Then repeat kill the redis process on S1 which was promoted to master and FS1 should be promoted to master. The redisson client will now fail reads/writes because the redisson client connections are to the old S1 node despite FS1 now being the new master but does not fail to poll for CLUSTER NODES because I believe it is using a separate connection pool/thread to do that.Redis version.3.2.11.Redisson version.3.7.0.

RedissonLocalCachedMap - "readAll*()" and "values()" methods could read from local cache only?The performance benefit of using RedissonLocalCachedMap over RedissonMap is negligible when getting all data from the map via readAllKeySet*(), readAllValues*(), readAllEntrySet*() and values(). The readAll*() methods still gets data from server, values() method is not overriden in RedissonLocalCachedMap.Would it be possible to read data only from the local cache in these cases?

Add CL.THROTTLE command for Redisson Client.I'm using the Redis Cell module for keeping track of rate limits on certain keys. Unfortunately with Redisson this means I have to use the low level client for now but it would be nice to include a method for the CL.THROTTLE command used in Redis Cell module with the high level client.This is not related to RRateLimiter which to my understanding is for throttling calls to Redis itself.Redis Cell.
Acquire Methods in RedissonRateLimiter Are Not Functional.Issue since Redisson 3.7.1.Line 125 of RedissonRateLimiter.java throws a null pointer exception when the time unit  parameter is null.

Redisson redlock performance with azure redis cache.Hi I have a distributed application that servers user requests. I want to implement distributed locking to synchronize access to user's data if multiple requests for the same user come in.I'm using redisson with azure redis cache in cluster mode with 3 masters, 3 slaves for this purpose. My incoming request rate is 700/s, with total request processing times ~30-40ms. I've set the redisson cluster config as below (pool size=320, lock_wait_time=3000ms, lock_expiry_time=3000ms). However, I notice that in spite of tuning the connection pool size from 250-700, a small portion of requests fail while waiting to acquire the lock.Questions:Is my usage of redisson redlock below correct?Any recommendations on how I can tune the config to resolve the "failed to acquire lock" errors?
In MapCache, idle timeout is not refreshed upon replace.When using redisson MapCache expiration I would like a replace to refresh the idleTimeout, so that a field does not expire as long as it is replaced within the idleTimeout period.  Note that replace returns the old value, so strictly speaking the value is accessed.Fields are expired after idleTimeout regardless of whether their values are replaced or not.Steps to reproduce or test case.a test added to RedissonMapCacheTest, I would like it to pass:
Too many open file handles with Redisson 3.7.0.Redisson 3.7.0 shouldn't leak file handles.After upgrading from Redisson 3.5.5 to Redisson 3.7.0 With Elasticache cluster I noticed file handles are left open and within an hour all the handles are exhausted causing AWS ECS to terminate the service instance. The issue goes away once I revert back to 3.5.5.Steps to reproduce or test case.Use Redisson 3.7.0 with AWS ElasticCache Cluster.ElasticCache cluster. Following is the Spring code to configure redisson with cluster:I've configured pool size at 20 and minimum pool size at 5. Scan interval is set at 2000 milliseconds.

Slow Redis Sentinel Initialization on Start (update from 3.6.5 -> 3.7.3)Hello,I'm updating Redisson lib from version 3.6.5 to 3.7.3. But I saw that Redis Sentinel initialization takes more times in the newer version 3.7.3. Is there's a new parameter to be aware of that could explain/solve this slow initialization ?I'm using the default Redis Sentinel configuration unchanged since version 3.6.5.Regards,Steps to reproduce or test case.Check connection initialization on Sentinel mode with Redisson on version 3.6.5 vs version 3.7.3.
Implementing Job Queue.Hey there,I'm trying to understand how to implement a job queue using this awesome library.I thought about this flow:New tasks are pushed to a pending tasks queue.Tasks taken for execution will be be popped from pending queue and pushed to in progress tasks queue.After X time inside progress queue, the task will be considered as expired and will be moved to a delay queue with a given delay (each task will have a different expiration time).After X time in the delay queue, the task will be moved back to the pending queue.If the task was executed properly, the task will be moved to a processed tasks queue, which will be consumed for further calculations.For the in progress tasks i thought about using priority queue / scored set.For the delay queue i thought about using, well, the delayed queue.Problem is I struggle about the durability of it all, I'm afraid the server will crash the second i pop something (before i get to add it to some other data structure) and I will lose tasks data.There is a feature for this library that I'm not aware of and could come in handy?I would really like to stick with Java and not move to python's celery or something like that, but haven't found something to ease the process yet.If this question is not for this place I'd be happy to hear where should I post it.Thanks and have a nice day :)
Global config codec is not registered in codec cache.When deserializing nested data structures the nested structure should use the codec instance assigned to the redisson config using setCodec.The nested data structure is serialized using the default JsonJacksonCodec codec ignoring the one set on Config using setCodec.Steps to reproduce or test case.Create a new JsonJacksonCodec using a non-default ObjectMapper instance.Assign that instance to Config using Config.setCodec.Stored a nested data structure such as a RBucketReactive inside of a RSetReactive, and store a POJO inside of the RBucketReactive that's dependent on the configuration of the ObjectMapper used previously.Attempt to retrieve the value from the RBucketReactive instance by iterating the RSetReactive contents and observe that Jackson deserialization will fail due to using a defaultly configured ObjectMapper.All defaults except for registering a new Codec.
LiveObjectService - ClassCastException when using multiple ClassLoaders.RedissonLiveObjectService creates proxy objects that are instanceof the given entity class.When using a different ClassLoader when loading the Class-To-Proxy for an LiveObject than when loading the Redission library all proxies creations will throw a ClassCastException.This is most likely due to the line.I think redission should use entityClass.getClassLoader() instead to make sure that the generated proxy object will be assignable to the given entity class.(As soon as spring-boot-devtools is removed from the classpath and there is only 1 ClassLoader around everything works perfectly fine)Steps to reproduce or test case.I've created a minimal repository that shows the error simply by running ./gradlew run in the project.If is removed everything works fine.

Redisson threw MOVED redirection loop detected.Steps to reproduce or test case.I updated redisson from 3.6.3 to 3.7.3, and use RLock for distribution system, It had no problem when it was in 3.6.3, but now it threw a exception above.Feel sorry I have no idea how to reproduce manually. It ran a while and then the exception threw.I used ClusterServersConfig as cluster mode configuration by default with just setting scanInterval property.
Connecting to AWS ElastiCache Redis in cluster mode behind NAT.I want to be able to use Redisson when Redis Cluster is behind NAT. I can think of following solutions:Disable auto discovery and use ElastiCache Management Nodes for all request (prefered approach recommendation in aws doc).Disabling auto discovery by manually registering all nodes in Redisson.Provide customer provide DNS mapping.I am using AWS ElastiCache Redis in cluster mode where AWS creates a management endpoint for whole cluster and separate endpoint for each master node. My whole cluster is behind NAT, so when Redisson tries to discover all the nodes in the cluster it find their local IP not the NAT IP, as a result it fails to connect to clustered nodes.Redisson discovers all the nodes in the clusters and tries to connect to them. However it fails because those IP/endpoints are behind NAT.Steps to reproduce or test case.Create an AWS ElastiCache Redis stack in cluster mode. Create a NAT on top of it and try to connect to the NATed cluster.
Connection is closed per command execution for master node used as slave in readMode = MASTER_SLAVE.This issue leads to new connection established per Redis command invocation and therefore performance degradation for master node used as slave.
How to use RKeys.findKeysByPattern() with Redisson Live Object(RLO)Hi,I'd like to ask a question about RLO and keys matching. I'm new to Redisson Live Object(RLO)I have POJO, and with a String field annotated with @Rid.  I'm able to use rLiveOjbectService.persist, and .get to save/retrieve the object based on the field value just fine.Questions:I have several RLO whose keys fit a specific pattern. I want to call RKeys.findKeysByPattern() to get all the keys that fit the specific pattern. Then I'll call rLiveObjectService.get(class, key) on the keys returned to get to all the objects that fit the pattern.However, it seems like findKeysByPattern doesn't work with RLO?From looking at the actual redis data, it seems RLO doesn't just use the value of the field annotated with @Rid as an actual redis key. It seems to do something special with the actual key name, so RKeys.findKeysByPattern() doesn't work anymore.What is the recommended way to get all the RLO objects that match a specific key pattern? Is it possible?Thank you so much.

Getting issues while using Redisson Tomcat session manager to share one redis instance among multiple tomcats.Hi,I am trying to use one redis instance for multiple tomcats to make session storage centralized for my application. But i am getting below error.As far as i understood redisson is not able to get the session created previously and then it goes on to create a new one. Because of this every time i use application on one tomcat to login it creates new session and when i come to other tomcat to use the same application its not able to find the created session and goes on to create a new one.But i do see all the sessions created in redis and being stored properly. Its just that redisson is not able to read the session.Below are my config:I am using redisson 3.7.4.

How to make Redisson update a cluster status with new nodes and new IPs.Is there a way to make Redisson client query the sentinel for Redis hosts in new IPs on a configured interval? or... should scanInterval be doing this?Elaborating, we have a Redis cluster with a Sentinel cluster, in a Kubernetes environment, so when Redis nodes are taken down and new ones arise, they have different IPs, and the old ones no longer exist.Reading online I'm aware of:But working with Redisson 3.7.4, clients keep logging that can't connect to some Redis node for days.Maybe the problem is that Redisson is not contemplating that nodes can change IP, or it only contemplates the IPs changing behind steady DNS names, but not sure.Is there a way to solve this problem?Redisson clients to get updated nodes when a Redis Kubernetes cluster is rebuilt and new nodes arise with new IPs. (no DNS names involved)When the cluster is rebuilt, clients keep logging connection errors for days.Steps to reproduce or test case.Having a Redis cluster, with a Sentinel in front of them, take down Redis nodes and bring up some new ones.

Spring Cache setting TTL on keys, not working as expected.We are using redisson with spring cache and setting ttl on our keys.:Redisson version is 3.7.0, Redis instance version 4.0.10.We are using redis single server.TTL settings is here:(with time to live of 10 seconds)Questions:with ttl settings shown above, after the cache value is set, in redis command line, every time I type command "ttl chatContext", it shows -2, not the remaining time to live.(it seems redisson is not making use of the redis ttl setting?)with the above ttl setting, after we put value in cache,if I keep querying the value of the "chatContext" value in redis command line, by typing "hgetall chatContext", then this value does not time out no matter after how many seconds.if I do nothing after the value is put in cache, and just wait for 10 seconds, then query the value of "chatContext" cache, its value is not available anymore, which is the expected behaviour.If we use cacheManager.setCacheNames(Arrays.asList("chatContext", "otherCacheNames")); then the cache value will never expire, the ttl settings of 10 seconds are ignored.

Redis node failover triggers 30x spike in Commands to the failover shard (using RBatch object)Redis node failover triggers 30x spike in Commands to the failover shard.Additional Description: We have Elasticache cluster with 2 shards* 6 nodes in each shard. Whenever a node failover occurs, the commands (HashCommands) that shard processes increases by 30x (For ex: ). No change in the incoming requests to service but the request/ commands processed by Redis goes up by 30x. Once we redeploy service, Redis commands to that shard will come to normal state.Updated redisson client to latest version. With redisson client update, we are seeing a performance hit. Latencies are increased by 25%. We haven't verified whether the issue is happening in latest version or not.Appreciate any inputs to debug what's happening here.: Failover should be handled gracefully.: Failover leads to increase in traffic to Redis.Steps to reproduce or test case:Failover Primary in one of the shard.
can we have an extra API on getNodesGroup.currently in Redissn class, we have the following API.can we expose an extra endpoint in Redisson class where we can get only certain Node type like Master?the request comes up when we are doing healthz check on our system, our system uses healtzh hook which deletes to redisson to check the health status of redis, currently, what we are doing is redisson.getNodesGroup().pingAll()which is not optimal, we would like the system to still work properly even when one slave is down, can we expose an extra API on this ?

Continuation to the Issue # 1562 (How to get All the Keys from org.redisson.jcache.JCache)Hi Nikita Koksharov,Thank you so much for your replay.I can Use Iterator but it will take more time to iterate each entry for capturing the key.is there any other way to do this.Tried with client.getMap() it is taking less time.For the region with 39450 keys.Iterator approach took 6301 ms.rmap.keySet() took 1377 ms.Here my concern is when i use rmap.keySet() i need a new client, i can't use the client in jcahe. Can you Please Suggest any other approach for this.Please find my code snippet for getting keys in both below.Thanks in advance.

redisson.getNodesGroup() returns Nodes where both redis-server and redis-sentinel are not running.the issue is like #1330, but they are different.I am not sure if this issue is being fixed in newer version, but this is for sure reproducible in 2.11.3, following is the steps to reproduce.having 3 redis vms running in Sentinel mode, current redisson.getNodesGroup().size() is 3  ---> as expected.bring down one of the redis boxes by shuting down both redis-server and redis-sentinel.redisson.getNodesGroup().size() is 2 ----> as expected.bring the node up agin, redisson.getNodesGroup().size() is 4 ----> something is wrong here.running steps 1-3 once might not reproduce the issue, but running it twice like following steps 1,2,3,2,3 will surface this issue, in fact it will lead the node size growing into 4, 5 and more.Following is what I did in the class RedisNodes.java.

Redisson Session Manager for tomcat is not able to serialize/deserialize session object when multiple web application (war file) share same session.hi, Need a help.our organization was using oracle web coherence for session management. there are around 15 modules deployed as war files which share the same session with different context for each war file.Coherence uses :: com.tangosol.coherence.servlet.AbstractHttpSessionCollection$GlobalScopeController in order to Share Session Information Between Multiple Applications. There is no class visibility issue by coherence session manager between applications sharing same session.see LInk:section: 4.2.2.1 Sharing Session Information Between Multiple Applications.Each context places some of its class in the session.setattribute and when using weblogic + coherence there was no issue with class visibility in session when the context gets changed during the user flow.Now, our organization is trying to migrate to tomcat + RedissonSessionManager. however there are issues with the redisson session manager. one class loaded in one context is not visible by session manager when the context gets changed. So, session manager is complaining about ClassNotFoundException as it does not have visibility to the classes which were loaded in session when the control was in previous session.Please let me know if there is any feature AVAILABLE in redisson session manager like oracle coherence has which makes it capable of viewing all the classes in the different war files (different contexts).

problem about RLock.lock() interruptedException?RLock.lock() does not return anything, is that mean a thread can always get the lock?After i saw the source code of lock funcation, it calls lockInterruptibly and catch the InterruptedException, it means that when a thread is interrupted by other thread, it will stop waiting and return from this lock function.so I tried a example in such way:There are two threads in my example, thread-1 gets the lock, and thread-2 is waiting for the lock, then main thread interrupts thread-2, and in this way, thread-2 actually does not get the lock, but thread-2 still stops waiting and return from lock() funcation and continues to do the business which should be locked.should i use the interruption status of current thread to check if the current thread has got the lock?Thank you very much!Steps to reproduce or test case.
Shade or unpackage snakeyaml.Redisson is packaging snakeyaml inside it's own redisson-all.jar library. This version is not shaded.When using Redisson as a Session Manager in Tomcat, Redisson has to be loaded in one of the class loaders above the webapps (Bootstrap, System or Common). Since redisson-all package snakeyaml, it will take precedence over any snakeyaml provided by the webapp.As a result, any application that use a snakeyaml's version different to Redisson may crash.Consider shading the snakeyaml implementation treat snakeyaml as a transitive dependency which could be overridden.Redisson and all other applications (ie Spring) are able to load yaml files.Steps to reproduce or test case.Install redisson in Tomcat in either of the following class loaders: Bootstrap, System or Common.In a webapp, using spring 5.0.8, load a yaml configuration file.
Non Sticky Session with tomcat 8: Session loaded in second node triggers new session event(tellnew)We are using Tomcat 8 session replication and some attributes are set in session listeners whenever a new session event is created. Configuration details are given below.When a request for a session (created in node 1 goes to node 2) is loaded from redis cache, we are getting the following error as one of the listeners is setting an attribute and the Session's isValid attribute is false at the time. is that for sessions loaded from redis cache, "session created" event (tellNew) should not be triggered.A probable solution would be to disable notification when setting the session id (ie) setId(id, false) in  RedissonSessionManager.findSession function.Steps to reproduce or test case.Add this listener to the application's web.xml.org.eclipse.birt.report.listener.ViewerHttpSessionListener.Start the loadbalancer and all tomcat nodes. Login to the application and browse through the application.The above error will be logged in the log files for the node that is trying to load the session from the redis cache.
RExecutorService task execution performance regression.RExecutorService task execution process got performance regression about x5 times, after #1468 had been resolved.
questions about redisson.These are questions about redissons rather than issues.I plan to use redisson in our company project, Use RLocalCachedMap to cache some business orders, but still have some questions about RLocalCachedMap since I can't get them from Wiki, API, Issue discussion in GitHub.read from map of RLocalCachedMap will always return the NEWEST data in real-time.clearLocalCache just clear the local data in JVM, it will not clear the data in Redis server, next read of clearLocalCache will sync the data from redis server to local JVM, right?How to get a Pro version of redisson, please send a email to haiyang.pan@gmail.com.

Spring webflow is throwing NoConversationException when we use RedissonSessionManager.I am using redisson-tomcat-8 3.7.5 version at tomcat level and my application is using spring-webflow.Facing below error when web-flow is proceeding from one state to another state.  Could you please suggest what I can do to get rid of these errors.PN: My application is not configured for spring-session dependencies and it solely depends on tomcat.Caused by: org.springframework.webflow.conversation.NoSuchConversationException: No conversation could be found with id '1' – perhaps this conversation has ended?
Driver Support for Redis Engine version 4.0.10.Hi,I'm using Hibernate-reids library for second level cache, can i point to the redis Engine version 4.0.10 ?as per the documentation it is mentioned that it has tested this with redis server 3.x. with Redisson 2.3.x.as per my opinion i'm using Redisson client 2.12.5 and  if Redisson client supports redis Engine version 4.0.10 then Hibernate-reids also should support.Please provide your inputs.Thanks in Advance.Srinivas.
Accumulation of MapCacheEvictionTask in Memory.When the RMapCache entries expire, the MapCacheEvictionTask should be cleaned up.MapCacheEvictionTask is leaking memory as more and more RMapCache gets created.Steps to reproduce or test case.We create millions of RMapCache a day. Over the course of a few days, the MapCachEvictionTask object stays in memory and is never cleaned up.
Using RScheduledExecutorServiceAsync to scheduleAsync a task is getting executed  before timeout/delay.I expect the output after 1200 seconds.. but I see it after 5 mins .. 300 seconds.The scheduled CallableTask should be executed after the delay has expired and not before that.
Why RedissonRedLock only unlock the acquired locks in the release stage?I expect that RedissonRedLock will release all the locks when it fail to acquire the lock.I learn about redlock from this page: Distributed locks with Redis, and it tell me that we should try to release the lock in all instances even if the lock was not acquired successfully, since may be we have executed the command successfully but the redis instance failed to send the response to the client.
lexicographically sort with ALPHA modifier.It looks that Redisson doesn't implement ALPHA in sorting. In Redis ALPHA  prevents "ERR One or more scores can't be converted into double".I found ALPHA only in  redisson-spring-data (RedissonConnection.java).Should I send PR?readSort returns Set with null.
DecoderException thrown when calling RMapCache.entrySet().iterator()Hi,I am working on a v1.5.15 Spring Boot project using Redisson v2.12.5 and Redis v3.2.10 on CentOS 7.I am storing an object as a value (using  the JsonJacksonCodec codec implementation) and the key is a String (using the StringCodec codec implementation) in a RMapCache. When I put data into the map there are no problems at all and I can see it on a GUI Redis tool but when I try to get it via RMapCache.entrySet(), the iterator() method throws the following exception:But RMapCache.get(key) method successfully returns elements from the map.Everything works great if I run the same code using a RMap instead of a RMapCache.Please find attached a small Spring Boot project to reproduce the error. Configuration values can be found in resources/config/application.properties file and the bean definition in resources/application-context.xml.
Unable to find maven artifact.Hi everyone,This is more a question than an issue. I'm using Spring Boot 1.5.x with Spring Data Redis 1.8 on top of JDK 1.8+ and I'd like to replace the Jedis client with Redisson. I was able to find the artifact org.redisson:redisson:3.7.5 on the Sonatype maven repository but I can't find org.redisson:redisson-spring-data-18:3.x in order to register a RedissonConnectionFactory bean. I forked and compiled the repository locally, but the artifact version I got after the compilation was 2.12.x which targets JDK 1.6+.Best,
Redisson reconnection issue in Kubernetes.When Redis in single server mode stops, its pod takes some time to restart. Redisson client should eventually reconnect.Redisson connectionWatchdog detects that redis is down and tries to reconnect but quickly stops trying, before redis is newly available.IP address does not change as redis is exposed via a kubernetes clusterIp service.Redisson never reconnects to redis.Steps to reproduce or test case.Deploy redis helm in single server mode. Connect a client from a pod inside the cluster. Stop redis pod manually.

I found two problems about Scheduled Jobs in redisson3.7.5.I am using scheduleWithFixedDelay to create a scheduled job, initialDelay is 0 and delay is 10m. When the job was running, I found the job's interval is 5min.I found the problem was created by ff..requestId, because the ExecutorOptions.default() is 5m.Debug the code, I know startTime is System.currentTimeMillis() + delay, but 'ff'..ARGV[2] is System.currentTimeMillis() + retryInterval. In my program, delay is 10m, retryInterval is 5m, so 'ff'..requestId is before requestId in zset named {jobName:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:scheduler. So, the job's interval is changed to 5 minutes.Another problem is that {jobName:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:retry-interval was deleted when only one Job was running and first run() was finish.When tasksCounterName's value is 0, tasksRetryIntervalName is deleted. But tasksRetryIntervalName can't be reset.

Redis- Master/slave role detection through DNS.Master connections should be created on new master.We are using Elasticache with 1 master and 1 slave. The redis endpoints are behind route53 record sets. When we swtich the endpoints in route53 to point to new master and slaves. The redisson is pointing to incorrect slave.Steps to reproduce or test case.where route53 recordsets are pointing redis-slave-1.dev.com to read endpoint of a node which is master.and redis-slave-2.dev.com points to read endpoint of node (slave).If we change the recordset redis-slave-1.dev.com (earlier pointing to master) to point to read endpoint of a node which is slave and we also switch redis-slave-2.dev.com (earlier pointing to slave) to point to read endpoint of node (master), then this error comes.The following logs are found:Then all the writes to redis are returning error with:Please note that redisson is easily able to detect master/slave and able to switch connections when doing promotion of a slave.It is also able to detect the DNS change successfully if the master endpoint is replaced by another cluster's master endpoint.But, when we switch the DNS in a manner so that the earlier recordset which was pointing to a master now points to a slave and vice-versa, redisson is unable to detect it.
Redisson Sentinel not executing scheduled task on Master-Slave Failover.I am running Redis in Sentinel Mode with 5 Sentinel, 1 Master and 2 Slaves. I am scheduling a task with Redisson. It is executing the scheduled tasks normally but if i bring down the Master and a new master is elected by the sentinels, redisson doesn't execute the previously scheduled task. Newly scheduled tasks are getting executed.Observation: The previously scheduled tasks are getting executed on restarting redisson node.Redisson Node should execute the previously scheduled task after master-slave failover.Redisson Node doesn't execute the previously scheduled task after master-slave failover.

Regression: DNS resolver failing to find valid DNS record.The DNS resolver should find valid DNS records. The hostname I'm having trouble with worked in 3.5.0, it is failing in newer versions.I opened a ticket with Netty first thinking it was a problem with the resolver itself, but after trying different Netty versions, it appears to be a configuration issue with how Reddison is calling the resolver.See netty/netty#8261.Exception thrown:Configure a top level domain someDomain on a DNS server you own.Configure a host under the new top level domain someHost.someDomain.Configure multiple resolvers  on the DNS client machine that will run the Netty code. i.e. 8.8.8.8, 192.168.1.1, and 10.0.0.1 (I have 3 resolvers configured, each pointing to different DNS masters  - global DNS, local personal private network, company private network over a VPN)Configure the search domain to not match the top level domain, i.e. search.otherDomain on the DNS client machine that will run the Netty code.Configure redisson to connect to someHost.someDomain.failure during configuration.

Custom URLStreamHandler is stripped off internally.I am running in Google App Engine Standard environment, which does not allow me to create/write to any files. The sslKeystore and sslTruststore configuration parameters are required to be URI objects. So I created a custom URLStreamHandler and created a custom URI out of the certificate object in memory.This should work as expected.However, it does not work as expected. Instead the custom URLStreamHandler is stipped off in RedisChannelInitializer.java, line number 140: However, in RedissonChannelInitializer.java, line 140, InputStream stream = config.getSslKeystore().toURL().openStream();`, when uri is converted to url using toURL().So I have modified the source code as follows and it works as expected for me.Change the type of sslKeystore and sslTruststore variables from URI to URL in RedisClientConfig.java and BaseConfig.java.Change the line 140 in RedisChannelInitializer to remove toURL().On a side note, I tried to push this modification to the redisson github repo on a new branch and then request a PR. But looks like I do not have some permissions as I get back a 403 response code.git push --set-upstream origin sslKeystore.remote: Permission to redisson/redisson.git denied to psubramanian2007.
support for tomcat websocket session.Will existing Redisson tomcat session support tomcat websocket session too?Tried persisting manually and encountered serialization exception.Looking into the code it seems redisson session extends standardsession and might not support websocket session.

Object mapping problem with Hibernate 5.3 and JCache.I tried to setup second level caching with Redis, Redisson and Hibernate 5.3. Since redisson-hibernate only supports hibernate (4.x, 5.1.x, 5.2.x), I tried the JCache setup.The example program crashes with the following exception if the first cache item should be written to Redis. Probably the Object Mapper (codec) configuration is incorrect:

org.redisson.tomcat.RedissonSessionManager renders tomcat8 useless if Redis server is down.Exception thrown if Redis-server is down, causes apps to stop working.This might be an intended behavior, but the presence of the centralized session backup is not mission critical for our system (only used for failover). But using this session manager will actually introduce a new critical error to our system, when/if the Redis server goes down.A flag/setting where communication errors with Redis would be logged instead of causing a "crash" would be highly appreciated.Tomcat uses the local session to service the request and ignores any store/find session issues related to communication with Redis-server.An Exception is thrown.
Memory leaks with LZ4/FST/netty.I'm using LZ4Codec to serialize and deserialize my data. I'm noticing some unclosed streams which are wasting a lot of heap space.These are the screenshots from the heap dump I took which shows the problem.Steps to reproduce or test case.Using RLocalCacheMap and Composite Codec try to serialize and deserialize a few 100 objects. Do not shutdown redisson.
Time to connect takes around 2 seconds.When I am trying to connect to redis it takes around 2 seconds. This started happening after I upgraded to 3.8.1 maven. This is the code used to connect. I initialize the connection every single time and close it down. Is there something I am doing wrong or is this a bug.
Warning with sensitive user data dispatched by CommandDecoder.When RedisTimeoutException occurs just throw the exception to the user code without printing any warning messages or at least do not include result of the GET command.We are storing sensitive data in redis cache. On rare occasions when GET command fails on timeout org.redisson.client.handler.CommandDecoder#completeResponse method prints warning message containing the command result which in our case is sensitive data stored in our redis cache.this is happening here : org/redisson/redisson/3.7.3/redisson-3.7.3-sources.jar!/org/redisson/client/handler/CommandDecoder.java:442.Since our code is also using slf4j for logging, this warning message is printed to the same file as other log messages and then is flushed to our log managing server.At this point we don't have control on this data and thus it will appear in our logging server. Due to GDPR concerns and inner regulations in our company we need to anonymize all user data stored in our systems, but it is hard to do when we have no control on the data dispatched to logs.While we will seek how to patch this for now, we think that other redisson customers could suffer from the same problem as we are and kindly ask you to remove sensitive contents from warning messages or set log message level to trace or debug or allow user code to control this.

How to use spring beans inside executor service task.Hi,Is it possible to access spring beans from within executor service tasks somehow?
Which readMode to use?We have Redis cluster with 6 nodes (3 masters and 3 slaves), and using redisson 3.6.5. In redisson cluster setting, we applied default value (SLAVE) on readMode.Here are some questions on this setting:What will happen if one of slave node fails? Will redisson detect the error and switch to master on Read, or it will try to connect to Slave only and throw exception?If we use MASTER_SLAVE, read operation will go to master/slave randomly or it has a way to go to slave first, and then master when slave fails?
Unexpected ClassCastException during RBatchReactive execution.Calling RBatchReactive.execute() should complete successfully.RBatchReactive.execute() triggers a ClassCastException to be thrown from org.redisson.command.CommandBatchService.handleSuccess(CommandBatchService.java:224) with the message of org.redisson.misc.RedissonPromise cannot be cast to org.redisson.command.BatchPromise.Steps to reproduce or test case.This was occurring in some code that looks like the following gist:Due to the nature of the code in question so mild anonymization has been applied to it.

Can Redisson be used for Tomcat session and application cache? Getting java.lang.ClassNotFoundException on read.I have a webapp using Redisson to handle Hibernate cache, application cache and session persistence.However, each time my webapp client attempt to READ back from Redis, Redisson give back an java.lang.ClassNotFoundException on every object saved in Redis.If I remove all lib from the lib folder and disable the session manager, the webapp client work perfectly.I suspect a class loader conflict, as Redisson's classes are loaded inside the Server Class loader, while the webapp classes inside the Webapp class loader. The sessions objects are working as all is handled at Tomcat level, but the client is jumping between both class loader.Anyone was able to get both working altogether, or is it require to use 2 Redis Java client implementation, one for the Session and the other for the Webapps?Tomcat sessions are saved.Object are saved and restored from Redis in the Webapps.Tomcat Session are saved and restored.Webapps objects are saved but cause a "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException" upon restore.Create a plain tomcat instance.Put redisson-all and redisson-tomcat jars in lib folder.Create a war with a 2 serializable entities and a servlet that read and save said entity in the session And the client directly (caching).

Redisson script caching.According to the Redis documentation, script caching is recommended, using EVALSHA and EVAL only if Redis server does not have the script already loaded, but I don't see this behavior in Redisson when using EVAL.This seems to be supported in Spring spring-data-redis using the default ScriptExecutor.Is there any script caching option I am not aware of? Is this going to be implemented if missing?

ReplicatedConnectionManager shuts down executor it doesn't own.When we pass an executor in the redisson config, redisson should never shut it down.ReplicatedConnectionManager calls stopThreads from the parent class MasterSlaveConnectionManager.  The stopThreads method calls executor.shutdown() without checking who owns it.Steps to reproduce or test case.This example should call stopThreads in the ReplicatedConnectionManager constructor because the config doesn't have any node addresses:
Redisson reconnection issue in SingleServer mode.Hi,actually our real application is running on Azure but I was able to compile a small application to demonstrate this issue locally. The main issue is that the reconnect behaviour of Redisson seems to be unreliable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't which seems to be rather independet of the choosen configuration options except for the retryAttempt and retryTimeout options. If those two options are too low the application is not able to recover in any case but this is expected behaviour of Redisson as far as I can tell.Example project: redissondemo.zip.Am I missing something here?Any help is appreciated!Redisson is trying to reconnect after a failure / failover of the Redis server.Redisson seems to be trying to reconnect but fails always except on a few non-reproducible occasions.Steps to reproduce or test case.If everything seems to be running fine, stop the docker container with "docker stop ".Wait some time and then start Redis again. I tried different intervals but it didn't seem to matter that much.Depending on the set of choosen configuration options 1 - 3 the DEBUG log output varies but the end result is the same: no reconnect is going to happen. I tried it with option combinations "1;2;3", "1;3", "2;3" and with significantly lower values for the retryAttempts (option 3.1) such as 3 e.g.. As soon as the connection is lost any retry attempt seems to fail.Although there seem to be exceptions from this behaviour. Sometimes the ConnectionWatchdog is taking action and is actually able to reconnect to the Redis server (Used configuration options: 1;2;3):

org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionClosedException received. MasterSlaveServersConfig.create function skips setting keepAlive flag.The value associated with the key.When I debug happy case I am seeing the actual redisClients in connectionFutures in async method of CommandAsyncService have keepAlive = false. I suspect this may the root cause.The connections seem to go stale after an unknown duration (verified that the server timeout is not affecting this)Looking in more detail, I see MasterSlaveServersConfig create(BaseMasterSlaveServersConfig<?> cfg)in MasterSlaveConnectionManager.java file is not setting keepAlive flag.This is extremely hard to repro and I couldn't debug a failure case yet; but it seems like we cannot rely on redisClient abstracting connection handling unless we are missing a config.Please advise.Steps to reproduce or test case.

Transactional RLocalCachedMap takes alot of time while putting.: Transactional put Should take slightly more time than normal put.: Taking almost 3000 times more time.
What is the best practice for setting local caches ttl against Redis caches?Is it correct if Redis cache ttl is the same as timeToLiveInMillis for local cache?MY_CACHE:
RLocalCachedMap fetches results even after disconnected from Redis Server.: Should provide multiple strategies to choose from like whether to allow reads or not while disconnected.: Reads are allowed by default.

All lua script are sent to slot 0 only.We use Reddison as a client for high load sharded Redis cluster consists of 8 nodes. Main use case -  big number of relatively small lua scripts. We use code like this to do it. (Used version is 3.7.5, but I believe same behavior is in trunk)RScript script = redisson.getScript();Long result = script.evalSha(RScript.Mode.READ_WRITE, loadedScript, RScript.ReturnType.VALUE, keys, values);After some performance tests we noticed that load on Redis cluster nodes is uneven - CPU utilization on node which holds '0 slot' was two times higher then on other nodes. It happens because Reddison sends all scripts to '0 slot' and then this node have to 'MOVED' script to correct node for processing. This overloads '0 slot' node.So we have to find a workaround to send scripts to correct node:Long result = script.evalSha(correctMessageKey, RScript.Mode.READ_WRITE, JsonJacksonCodec.INSTANCE,  loadedScript, RScript.ReturnType.VALUE, keys, values);So I wonder if this a bug or feature?
Missing code on version 3.8.2 at Maven Central.Hi,When I debugged the class MultiDnsAddressResolverGroup and compared with this commit:I found that the code deployed to https is missing this line (that is supposed solve the issue).Maybe this code is missing in the compiled version too?
Question regarding AWS elasticache.I am new redis and AWS elasticache and I am working on a legacy codebase which uses oracle coherent caching. I need to replace it with AWS elasticache and Redission does that. But me being new not able to find how to actually use Redisson for this. Elasticache endpoint is private so that cant be passed to redission client.Please help me with providing an example so that i can actually progress on this.Thanks.Steps to reproduce or test case.
Questions about performance of RLocalCachedMap.I'm playing with the Redisson's great feature for near cache, then did some benchmark testing on it.It brings a huge performance boost compares to directly interacting with redis, however it's takes much longer than "real" local cache, especially for put operation, around 100~200 times longer. For instance, each Redisson fastPutAsync takes around 175536ns, while real local cache finishes in 1060ns; Redisson get takes 9737ns, real local cache takes 151ns. This can become quite noticeable for read/write intensive applications.From the reading on document/wiki on RLocalCachedMap, it essentially keeps a local copy of the cache in application's memory, performance should be roughly the same as real local cache. Any thoughts / suggestions on the slowness of RLocalCachedMap please?Thanks.

Does RedissonRedLock support Redis cluster Master/Slave mode?In this issue#1333 (comment)  I found that RedissonRedLock supports Redis cluster mode. In the Redlock algorithm, I don't think it supports  Master/Slave mode.The description is:In the distributed version of the algorithm we assume we have N Redis masters. Those nodes are totally independent, so we don’t use replication or any other implicit coordination system.I am troubled. Does it support  type of  Redis cluster 1 ?If it supports then how do I add a configuration, whether the master and slave are added or only the master configuration is added.Which type should I choose,or they are all wrong?

Unable to send command on Azure Redis.Hi,I would like to ask for your help because I experienced a lack of connection with the PaaS Azure element of Redis Cache last Saturday.The exception thrown is related to CommandAsyncService, please find in the attachment.I’m using version 3.6.5 of redisson, in the following you find redisson.conf.It seems that in that day the tomcat running on a VM could not write on Redis with commands HMSET and DEL, throwing the exception mentioned before. The immediate solution was to restart tomcat service so that connection was re-established.Do you know if this issue is fixed in later versions? What would you suggest to do in this circumstances?
ScheduledExecutorService schedule does not run subsequent executions.If execution of the cron task takes longer than its period, then subsequent executions should start late, but not removed.When the cron task takes longer then its period, the subsequent scheduler is removed and the task is never run after.Steps to reproduce or test case.Worker to run JobA:When the worker starts it will execute the JobA only once. I checked the Redis and the scheduler key under JobA is removed after. This happens when the task takes longer to complete than rate.
Can redisson allow 1 sentinel with configuration?In each ENV, redisson works fine. I understand at least 2 sentinels can guarantee master->slave failover, but in our SMALL ENV, we only have 1 master, no HA required. we are forced to use redisson old version(3.6.0) as it allows 1 sentinel. The reason why keep sentinel here is to make it no difference with M and L environment, we can use very same redisson configuration and code in each ENV.My suggestion is to make it configurable, so that redisson reject 1 sentinel configuration by default but allows user to enable it in case needed.When in SMALL ENV, redisson will throw below exception:throw new RedisConnectionException("At least two sentinels should be defined in Redis configuration!")Steps to reproduce or test case.

Spring Boot starter fails with NPE on redisProperties.timeout reference.Spring Boot application using redisson-spring-boot-starter runs without exception and connects to Redis server.Spring Boot application fails to start with stacktrace due to NullPointerException in RedissonAutoconfiguration. The issue is that there is a reference to RedisProperties.timeout that calls timeoutValue.getClass() without first checking to see if the value returned is an Class and thus the NullPointerException is thrown. Added a spring.redis.timeout value to the configuration avoids the issue, but that shouldn't be required.Steps to reproduce or test case.Only basic spring.redis.host and spring.redis.port configuration.

Custom classes using Jackson must explicitly enable TypeId serialization if final.Objects for values used in redisson classes such as RMap and RBucket can be  non-final classes without annotating explicitly.When serializing non-final classes using Jackson, the type id is not used.  When reading such classes, redisson always explicitly passes Object.class to Jackson for deserialization which requires type id in "@Class" field causing missing typeid exception.This is more of a problem using Kotlin due to final being the default modifier for classes, and the only modifier for data classes.   The errors and solution are non obvious.    Registering modules or explicitly attempting to force enableTypeId via ObjectMapper configuration does not work.Annotating  the classes with @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY)  or forcing non-final classes, and not using any kotlin 'data' class does work.Steps to reproduce or test case.Suggestion: The core cause is in the Redisson JsonJacksonCodec Encoder and Decoder.The Encoder calls objectMapper.writeValue() using the object instance supplied -- this internally will resolve to the instance class (not the declared class of Object). The default Jackson encoding behaviour will only add type id if this is a non-final class.The Decoder, on the other hand, explicitly passes in a Object.class as the type to deserialize. Object.class is ALWAYS non-final so will always require type id.This fundamentally cannot work without additional type information being stored in redisson. Suggest, as Jackson APIs allow, to allow for passing in the and storing the class used when creating container objects and collections so that it may be explicitly passed instead of Object.class. Creative use of generic class instantiation can partially solve this in pure java for generics.

Old master connection still existing in MasterSlaveEntry.writeConnectionPool after switchover(changeMaster)In MasterSlaveEntry, after switchover(changeMaster), all oldMaster connections are kicked off from writeConnectionPool.If changeMaster happens, meanwhile  old master connection is during reconnecting, old master connection will still exists in writeConnectionPool(even it becomes slave).See below logs from example:
Fundamental API design flaw -- with respect to encoding and serialization.The stated purpose of the library behaves as documented and expected -- i.e. users should not need to be aware of implementation and it should "just work".   One stated goal/priority for reddison is that users can use existing or new java classes 'As Is' and simply use reddison as a transparent native object database.   This is a very compelling feature (which has been attempted many times over the last 30+ years).  Considering the maturity and feature rich nature of the product I nievely assumed that this would 'just work' as intended (of course accepting some edge cases that are problematic.)In particular, with the variety of codecs, including Jackson -- which is if not the single most used JSON data mapper/serialization library, atleast in the top 3, that if a class could round-trip serialize with Jackson that class would be equally usable with Reddison -- this is explicitly stated (with some caveots).By leveraging the work of existing encoders (like jackson) it is natural to assume that this is not magic -- it would work 'as good as' whatever encoder was configured, so if one has domain knowlege in that encoder and has created classes which behave nicely with that encoder then Reddison would indeed be a transparent 'Drop In' -- and be able to use the the other really awesome features provided.It simply does not work this way, and can not work as stated with the existing APIs.I believe this is due to a fundamental difference in how various encoders/codecs work, and not fully understanding the subtleties.   Some encoders work by always storing the type information with data so that deserialization is possible from the data alone with no external context or special per-instance configuration.    Other encoders (such as Jackson) prioritize round trip to user controllable serialization formats.   The concept being that the codec can be configured such that the output (JSON in this case) is produced in a form that either pre-exists (must be matched exactly) or 'user friendly' (intentionally undefined -- but again, assumed to exist and must be matched).To achieve this, the default mode, and in fact almost all features of Jackson are designed to NOT embed type into the JSON data itself, but rather to make use of the serialization or deserialization dynamic context (and other out-of-band configurations) to be able to parse 'arbitrary' JSON 'as is' into the expect type.   This is fundamentally different approach and goals then codecs which produce 'black box' output and instead focus on minimal or no out-of-band context needed to round trip Java objects.The side effect is that in order for Jackson to function properly (i.e. in the use cases it was primarily designed for), type information MUST be provided out-of-band in order to deserialize.The exception, which is not commonly used, and which recently has been shown to be a severe security problem,  is the special mode of embedding type information with each JSON element.These modes are not interchangeable and have non-compatible requirements, and in general are 'all or nothing' -- you must code for one or the other mode explicitly and consistently.The current Reddison APIs cannot handle either mode correctly in many cases.  For example, RBucket, without extreme hacks, cannot round trip most non-primitive objects -- even basic Java Bean or POJO.This is NOT solvable by simply overriding the codec and tweaking it somehow -- because internally, in intentionally non-exposed implementation code, the necessary usage of the core Jackson APIs are incorrect and inconsistent in at least a few places.   The default Jackson codec uses a non-standard configuration of the ObjectMapper which is not able to round-trip consistently given the implementation of the deserializer (which in many places pasess a literal Object.class as the target type)I have found that it is possible to hack this on a case by case basis by 'creative' (i.e. probably will break many other things) mangling of the codecs -- on a per use basis -- It still requires every API call to use a distinct codec taylored for the type,  and I have no idea what will happen with nested RObjects -- or other internal code -- What this demonstrates, in my opinion, is that the API itself needs to be enhanced slightly to accommodate the behaviour of codecs which need out of bound type information,not by making this a burden on the users -- particularly since this relies on understanding many details of the private implementation of Reddison to work -- with no assurance that ones understanding is fully correct or that the undocumented internal implementation will not change.This essentially makes Reddison unsuitable for large classes of its intended use cases.  That is sad, as I was looking forward to making use of the AWESOME features it does provide -- to be blocked by a few fundamental API flaws.Recomendation:Solving this problem is not complex, but it cannot be done cleanly by end users, it needs to be implemented internally and exposed through the APIs.There are various other products which do this exact thing that can be used as a model for what is needed.Essentially -- every API which deserializes a user defined object MUST have some mechanism of providing the target class explicitly. For example: Jackson itself has a Class argument for every method which does deserialization.   This is not just an 'advanced' feature, its necessary for all but a few special cases.cache2k https solves the problem by making use of a rarely known, subtle feature of Java which provides a way to prevent type erasure of generics. E.g.This subtle 'trick' of creating a anonymous type explicitly (note the "{}" at the end -- critical), allows the cache to access the generic parameter types and use them later as needed for deserialization.Using the first suggestion, I believe all it would take to make RBucket.get() to work properly is to add the class argument to get.Yes this is ugly and yes this breaks some of the simplicity of implementing interfaces that do not have this signature -- but at least it works reliably and doesn't require the end user to have deep domain knowledge of both the codecs and reddison to handle basic simple java classes as the framework is designed to do.   This would have to be done likewise to all the methods which deserialize top level objects.   Once the top level class is properly deserialized, all its internal references will work fine (if you allow Jackson to do it for you)  -- Jackson will use the declared type of the parents reference variable to deserialize the children.   All the subtleties of how to get this to work are then defered to jackson and whatever customization one needs to do via annotations and configurations are all Jackson problems.That way you could truly state that "If a class round trips through Jackson using the provided ObjectMapper then Reddison will work correctly for that class without changes or custom configurations needed".I do not know the extent this affects internal code -- this is why I am not attempting to implement this as a PR -- I suspect that I would need to fully understand all the intricacies of Reddison to make sure I got all the cases correct -- I believe the author is the best source of this domain knowledge.   By the time I fully understood all the code enough to make this change, I would probably end up writing my own version -- which is exactly what I did NOT want to do when I discovered Redisson.Note that these suggested approaches are NOT simply having the user customizing the codec -- the codec is not the right place to store per-type per-use information, that needs to come from the callsite directly, either in the creation of the R or in its methods -- One could still store the necessary class information in the codec as is done in the JsonJacksonMapCodec -- but 'hide' this from the user -- that is an implementation choice.For JVM Languages which handle generics 'better' , such as Kotlin, one could write a wrapper around Reddison to provide the simpilier APIs and manage the explicit class arguments in the wrapper.This is what the Jackson Kotlin module does.Most of this module is a single source file that provides 'extension functions' which convert the generic template types into explicit class types to pass to Jackson.This is not possible in pure Java, which is why cache2k uses its subtle 'trick' during the cache creation to extract the generics class types.Note: that the problem exists in Reddison even without user supplied classes begin generic/templates --.this is an issue with even basic POJO type classes with no inheritance, generics, or other 'advanced' features -- Reddison simply does not supply the API's necessary to deserialize these properly using codecs like Jackson which require out of band (or context provided) type information.You just cant get there from here ...Note: I was very surprised that such a simple use case failed -- until I checked the test cases in the examples and all of them which would have triggered these problems were using basic types (String, Int, Long) not custom classes.  Those types do not need any out of band type information so they do work just fine.   Similarly, the Reference class handles this problem in its own way (and may in fact be unnecessary if the above suggestions are implemented -- not sure)Steps to reproduce or test case.

RedissonSessionManager - Tomcat - User Session expiring 30 minutes after initial session creation regardless user is actively making transactions and ttl being reset.redisson session manager is creating sessions which is getting expired after 30 minutes even if the user is actively making transaction. Who is controlling the session expiry?  in tomcat web.xml session timeout is set as 30 minutes.  when user is making active transaction, redis desktop manager is showing that the ttl value of the session is getting reset to 30 however still the session is getting expired exactly after 30 minutes of initial session creation. so definitely ttl value which is getting reset to 30 minutes is not deciding the session expire. which factor is expiring the session? How and where that parameter can be set for redisson session manager so that session does not expire when user is actively making transactions.If user is actively making transactions, same session should be active all the time since the time user is active.Session manager  expiring the session after 30 minutes since initial login/session creation time even if user is actively making transactions.Steps to reproduce or test case.

RedissonSession#changeSessionId doesn't change the id in redis.When call RedissonSession.changeSessionId(), the session id did not change in redis. So, when call another request , redisson cannot find the session in redis.Steps to reproduce or test case.spring boot autoconfig with single mode.

Wrong command timeout for check master functionality.When usingreplicatedServersConfig configuration you cannot set low retryAttempts & retryInterval without getting command execution timeouts for the check master functionality, which ensures that the client knows which nodes that are master and which aren't.The timeout for getting a connection, sending the command and waiting for the response is calculated by retryInterval * retryAttempts in the version of redisson that we use currently (2.8.24).From what I can see the command timeout calculation was introduced in following issue, #1280 (commit was kinbod@387ed74)It actually seemed to have changed in following commit, 338f9d0, which is included in a later version than we use currently. Now the command timeout is instead set by what timeout value you have set. This commit would probably get rid of the exceptions for command execution timeout for our application, since it uses timeout instead of retryInterval * retryAttempts.I suggest a change to make this a configurable value for the replicatedServersConfig. This would make it would be possible to have very low values configured for timeout, retryAttempts & retryInterval without it affecting the check master functionality.Since checking if a node is master is scheduled to be done periodically in the background it is not that important, at least for us, that this will timeout quickly. It is however important to us that we do timeout quickly for the app/user initiated commands. Making this value configurable would make sure that it possible to configure redisson for such a scenario.The timeout for checking if a node is master or not, using INFO REPLICATION command, should not be shorter than the total time of command timeout and server response timeout for user/app initiated commands. I expected the time for the timeout to be calculated as (retryInterval * retryAttempts + 1) + timeout to give it the same amount of time to get a connection, send the command and await the response as user/app initiated commands.The timeout is calculated using retryInterval * retryAttempts. This seems wrong since it makes the total timeout shorter compared to an app/user initiated command. I would expect it to be at least the same amount of time by default.Steps to reproduce or test case.Add a latency toxic higher than 50 ms to one of the redis nodes, and ensure that your java application uses the address and port exposed by toxiproxy.Update your java application to use the redisson configuration defined in this issue.Start your java service..You will now get exceptions starting with the message text:Command execution timeout for command: (INFO REPLICATION)

RedissonClient still points to failed AWS Elasticache Redis node when failover happens.I tested AWS Elasticache Redis failover (manual test). First I started my app which creates one  Redissonclient. It established 67 connections to primary Redis node. Then I manually did failover primary test.All 67 connections point to new primary Redis node.33 connections still point to previous (failed) primary Redis node, 34 connections point to new primary Redis node.Steps to reproduce or test case.Start my app which creates one Redissonclient.Go to AWS Console, Elasticache, Redis and select redis cluster you are using. It shows all of nodes of the cluster. Check the primary node, go to Action and select "Failover primary".Wait for a while, run step 2 command, out of 67 connections, half of them are pointing to previous primary node, half of them are pointing to new primary node.From AWS Console, if you select previous and new Redis primary nodes, then look at "Current Connections" of CloudWatch metrics, you can get the same result: Redisson client points to both previous and new Redis primary nodes. Following screenshot shows Redis primary node failover from 003 to 004.
Slave connection will not recover from freeze mode after failover.Hi!I am testing failover behavior of redisson on AWS Elasticache in replicatedServers mode with one master and one slave. I am using read mode MASTER_SLAVE. After the failover is finished redisson correctly detects the new master and redirects all traffic to the master. The slave needs around 5 minutes to recover on Elasticache. Redisson is continously checking that connection, but after recovering that connection it does not move traffic to the slave.Traffic should again be load balanced between master and slave after failover is completed.Connections to master and slave are established but all traffic is routed to master.By debugging i identified that the slave connection will remain freezed with FreezeReason Manager.Steps to reproduce or test case.Start app with replicateServers mode with one slave and one master.Start failover on AWS console and wait until it is finished.Watch traffic on slave. -> nothing.

Return the same object in http request processing when session.getAttribute is called, add any "mutable" objects return from session.getAttribute to a tracker that will update Redis session key values at the end of the request processing.When web application gets an object from the http session, then the same object should be returned during the request processing instead of returning deserialized version of the object each time.Also each object that is "mutable" should be kept track on and at the end of the request processing should be updated to Redis server as web application could have altered the object without invoking session.setAttribute.When in readMode=REDIS each time session.getAttribute will return a new object instead of returning the same object returned by the first session.getAttribute during request processing.When web application retrieves an object from the session and alters it then at the end of the session the Redis server won't be updated with the updated copy of the object.Steps to reproduce or test case.Try to get the object in readMode=REDIS and each time a new copy is returned during the same request processing.Try to update the object returned by session.getAttribute - the modified version of the attribute won't be in Redis server at the end of the request processing and the next request processing will have the old version of the object deserialized from Redis server.

"RedisException: MOVED redirection loop detected" is popped out after Redis Master nodes down and up.We have application using Redisson to access Redis cluster(16 masters+16 slaves).We have a test case which is to shutdown one or more Redis Master nodes then take them up.We expect after the action above(Redis Master nodes down and up), the Redisson can still find the right node when accessing Redis.For example, there 2 Servers 192.168.0.78 and 192.168.0.79.There are 8 master Redis nodes on 192.168.0.78 with port 6000-6007, the slaves of the 8 masters are 6100-6107 on 192.168.0.79.The same, there are 8 master Redis nodes on 192.168.0.79 with port 6000-6007, the slaves of the 8 masters are 6100-6107 on 192.168.0.78.The test case is that all the Redis nodes on 192.168.0.79  are shutdown then taken up.So after shutting down, all the Redis nodes on 192.168.0.78 become Master. And after the Redis nodes on 192.168.0.79 are taken up, the Master Role of 6100-6107 on 192.168.0.78 will be switched back to 6000-6007 on 192.168.0.79, which is done by another script according to our function definition.At that time, Redisson will report the exception like below:The below is the information of "monitor" on 192.168.0.78:6103:It seems the request which should be sent to 192.168.0.79:6003 has been sent to 192.168.0.78:6103, which makes 192.168.0.78:6103 get extra load.So it means the Redisson sends requests to the wrong Redis nodes after the action above, which is regarded as a wrong behavior.Steps to reproduce or test case.Like the "", setup Redis cluster on 2 servers with each having 8 masters + 8 slaves, the slaves should belong to the masters on the other server. Then shutdown and start all the Redis nodes on one server. Meanwhile, keep the Redisson sending requests to the Redis cluster.

Huge log messages.Issue similar to #1035 (redisson 3.10.1), probably introduced in commit 60352b8 (or may be f095327).Recieve big message, get timeout, tens megabytes log message:
After Redis failover, the number of connection to the new slave is 1 instead of 34.I just realized issued #1845 had been closed. This issue is related to #1845 fix.I have verified that previous master node was added back as a slave node after failover with release 3.10.1. Thanks for the fix. But the number of connections to the salve is only 1 instead of 34. Is this expected? I tested a couple of times and got the same result. Following screen shot shows two tests. I started the app, Redisson established connections to both 003 and 004. Then I did failover from 003 to 004. After failover was done, there was only one connection to 003. Then I restarted the app to make sure Redisson re-established connections to both 003 and 004. I did failover from 004 to 003. After failover was done, again there was only one connection to 004. ( You can run netstat -nt | sort +5 | fgrep .6379 | grep -n ^   from app box to see the connections)

Custom codec not working after version 3.10.0.We have been using a custom KryoCodec(overriding the built in one) for a while but after version 3.10.0 this no longer works. The change that affects us are introduced by the following commit: 37b58db.I've spent a little bit of time looking into what's going on and it looks like there are issues regarding classloading since we got all sorts of exceptions now, especially lots of com.esotericsoftware.kryo.KryoException: Unable to find class on classes that we have been serializing without problems til now. The root cause is of course  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:x.y.z.I've attached the relevant code with the working and non working solution:The only change on the latter is the addition of the new constructor which now is required.
RInject enhancement.Motivation.Currently it requires some boilerplate work to acquire a desired object in remote tasks. It would be better if the desired object can be obtained via object injection.Currently it is not very easy to inject a bean of collection type via Spring's autowire function.The work is to overcome the above difficulties while provide an easy to access Redisson provided objects via injection methods.Enhance the RInject annotation's capability in general:to allow direct injections of RedissonClient, RObjects and RLOs.to allow specify codec used to create RObjects and RLOs.to allow RInject support object creation based on Redisson expression when target type is a super type or interface.Enhance the RInject annotation's capability in Spring environment:to have everything from above.to allow RInject behaves similar to @Autowired that can provide lookup/creation and injection of RObjects and RLOs in Spring environment.to allow RInject behaves similar to @value that can utilise SpEL expression and Spring property expression to provide dynamic runtime injection of RObjects and RLOs in Spring environment.to allow RInject support object creation based on Redisson expression when target type is a super type or interface.

RedissonNamespaceHandlerSupport fail to load at Tomcat startup.The scenario is a Spring based application deployed on top of Tomcat 8 configured to use the RedissonSessionManager.At startup, Spring initialization try to discover on classloader the namespace handlers including the org.redisson.spring.support.RedissonNamespaceHandlerSupport provided with the reddisson-all.jar library.At this point the init of this handler fails with a NoClassDefFoundError probably because the Tomcat classloader cannot see Spring dependencies that are loaded by webapp classloader.Unfortunately, after this WARN, the RedissonSessionManager doesn't work properly and new sessions are not stored on Redis.Here the complete stacktrace:After some tests, we try to solve this problem by removing the following files from redisson-all-3.10.2.jar:so there is no need of Sprint integration in our case.There is any solution/configuration we can adopt to avoid this error and keep the original library?

Redisson hibernate entity cache TTL and MaxIdleTime not being set - default region used for entities 2nd level cache.The TTL and MaxIdeltime once set should auto-evict the hibernate entity beans cached in redis.The beans are not auto-evicted when TTL expires and the idle time has elapsed.Steps to reproduce or test case.Step 1)Create a simple entity bean (Say - com.jhipster.demo.blog.domain.Tag)Step 2)Annotate the same with the following.Step 3)Try to set the TTL and config via code.NOTE: The auto-eviction with TTL set at code level works for Spring cache only not hibernate second level cache for entity.Step 4)I also tried to set the TTL and max idle time via application.properties file.NOTE: I thought of using the application.properties file (since I am using spring boot, this file is auto picked)I got this idea of overriding the default from the following Redisson link -.In that link I see default properties being set for  all entity like -.So I thought I can set the same via spring boot application.properties file.Anyhow both Step 3/4 does not set the TTL correctly for me and the entity is not auto-evicted.NOTE: The auto-eviction with TTL set at code level works for Spring cache only not hibernate second level cache.I am using the single server mode and the configuration is the defualt as outlined in the link below for "singleServerConfig".NOTE: I am using Hibernate 5.3.7, Spring boot 2.1.2, Redisson 3.10.2 version.
Why does LocalCachedMap.readAllValues() need to avoid reading phantom value?This is to avoid reading phatom local values.Originally posted by @jackygurui in #1823 (comment)However mrniko said If element has been added/removed then invalidation message sent to all LocalCachedMap instances and element evicted in all of them.(#592 (comment))What mrniko said means local cache will be synced by Redis pub/sub mechnism. If so, why does jackygurui said LocalCachedMap.readAllValues() need to read redis value to avoid reading local phantom value? Since local cache value will be synced, I think there is no phantom local values.

redisson-tomcat-9 session manager does not work with Async servlets.My software is using JAXRS with AsyncResponse.I tried to use Redisson to store sessions of Tomcat 9.x in Redis, but I always get an exception.I checked this exception and the reason seems to be that the UpdateValve class seems to call the default constructor of the Tomcat ValveBase class without a boolean flag indicating that it should support Async servlets.This is a big showstopper since all servlets in our software are async and we don't want to convert them to synchronous ones since that will have a big impact on thread use and overal performance!Session object properly deserialise.Steps to reproduce or test case.Try to use redisson to access session objects from an async servlet.

Evict delay bug.evict old keys even with acceptable delay.eviction delay is too big due to bug.Steps to reproduce or test case.use cache with ttl 10min or 1hour.in EvictionTask#run is delay that starts with 5seconds and is multiplied by 1.5 if no eviction is needed. therefore in first 10 minutes without evicting is many times multiplied and resulted to delay 110 or 165 seconds. that is CORRECT.But after 10 minutes running evicting is started and this delay remains at this big value and is NOT decreased due to BUG. In production is this delay very big and redis is not fast enough in evicting and available memory is fulfilled. Jedis consumes under 100MB, redisson consumes 1GB(config limit) in short run.Redisson configuration.SingleServer and also on SentinelServer.

Redisson Map Cache Event Notification doesn't work with HPE's NONSTOP OS.Redisson Map Cache Event Notification doesn't work with HPE's NONSTOP OS.This is because of the endianness.Below logic is there in MapCacheEventCodec.decode(ByteBuf buf, State state, Decoder<?> decoder) method,Here, if it is windows, buf.readIntLE() is used, or else buf.readLongLE() is used. But for HPE's NONSTOP OS, buf.readLong() has to be used.To fix this, two classes has to be modified,RedissonMapCache - Like how isWindows is being set using "Windows" substring, isNonstop boolean also can be initialized using "NONSTOP" substring.Also, while initializing MapCacheEventCodec, need to pass isNonstop boolean.new MapCacheEventCodec(codec, isWindows, isNonstop) - in all the 4 places.MapCacheEventCodec - Need to declare isNonstop boolean and initialize(in constructor) based on the isNonstop boolean that is received from ReidssonMapCache.Also, in the decode method, like how isWindows is being checked, need to check isNonstop and use buf.readLong() if it is NONSTOP as given below.Could you please fix this in Redisson code?

Not null value is returned after ttl expires.I wrote the following code:And then I expect, that rmap.get("1") will return null, but it returns previously set value.I tried to debug library code and found the following:AbstractCacheMap removes value from cache and so get(Object key) returns null.after that RedissonLocalCachedMap/RedissonMap.getAsync() goes to Redis and my value there still exists.so RedissonLocalCachedMap calls cachePut(cacheKey, key, value), and expired value is again in cache.

Building Cache Memory Problem with Rmap.When we use RMap, we find that memory can't be released, which leads to frequent fullgc in the production environment. Is there a solution or optimization update of relevant modules now?The version we used was 3.8.2.
AWS ElastiCache Redis Cluster & Redisson-OOM.We are currently facing some issues with ElastiCache/Redisson without being able to determine the root cause so far - thus I'm giving it a try here ...We've set up ElastiCache in cluster-mode (3 Nodes) - and configured Redisson correspondingly.We are using distributed locks and some RMapCaches. The caches have a max-size (thus LRU-eviction) and TTLs set for both lock as well the cache entries.During the last few months we ran into a couple of out-of-memory-related outages - that is Redis runs OOM, not the client.The memory consumption is usually staying constant (limited by the LRU policy and TTL) for weeks but then tanks out of of the blue.  Per "step", the memory consumption does pretty much double. The "step down" in memory takes 1-2 hours before stabilizing on a lower level.According to our statistics, the number of keys remains constant - less than 100 of which 15 belong to the caches and the rest being TTLed-locks. The number of keys (entries) per cache is also constant - with either well below the size ceiling or the LRU is recognized (=ceiling not exceeded).I'm wondering whether somebody has seen a similar issue?With Redisson 3.10, there's a new option to determine the size of an RMap - so we'll use that to investigate further - but I suspect that the size of individual cache entries (which, in theory, could cause this) is not the reason. If we had huge entries, we'd expect to see a recovery after the TTL period, but this is not the case.Just from gut feeling, it feels as if this is somehow related to a replication - that would at least explain those "steps" to some degree.

Bug: Tomcat with 'updateMode=AFTER_REQUEST' will not remove attributes.Hi all!We use Redisson with the tomcat-8 integration. Because this is a legacy application with mutable session objects we have to use updateMode=AFTER_REQUEST.The problem we faces is that this update mode will not be able to sync removed attrbutes to redis and inform other running tomcat instances. This is bad because our other instances of Tomcat ends up using removed attributes.It's actually easy to spot the bug if one inspect RedissonSession.java#L267-L276:You can see that removeAttributeInternal only does publish the removed attribute if updateMode=DEFAULT. This would be fine if Redisson somehow stored which attribute names which was removed so that they also was synced in the store function triggered by  the UpdateValve.The problem is that store will only save the current attributes (see RedissonSession.java#L278-L303) on the session, and not the removed attributes. Handling removed attributes will require that Redisson  keeps control of both the added and the removed attributes within one request cycle (the same attribute may be added and removed multiple times).How can this be fixed?Solution 1: relax AFTER_REQUEST.I would argue that you actually want all session attributes to be synced as soon as possible. But in the rare scenario where you operate on mutable session data you would do an extra force-update after the request completes.The proposal would be to replace AFTER_REQUEST mode with FORCE_UPDATE_AFTER_REQUEST. Then all addAttrbiute & removeAttribute should be synced as soon as possible, the same way you get with the DEFUALT mode today. But in addition you will get all attributes synced after the request completes. This would be easy to implement as it will only require removal of the if-guard inside the removeAttributeInternal function.It could also be beneficial if one is able to specify a white-list of attributes known to be immutable.Solution 2: Redission keeps track of removed attributes.In this solution Redisson needs to keep track a map of removed attributes during a request cycle and make sure to remove these attributes from redis and notify all other tomcat instances. This will be more complex to implement correctly than solution 1.

High memory consumption in netty theads.We are on version 3.7.2 and only using RMap, RScoredSet and are facing the same issue in production where netty threads used by redisson consumed 12GB of total 16GB of allocated heap space in one application and 8GB out of 16 GB on another application . One observation i have made is that netty threads had created around 275,000 thread local maps with each consuming around a fixed amount of heap. It all seems to be related with weblogic context aware classloader because it is shared by all the netty threads.Since the heap dump is quite large I will be attching the screenshots.@mrniko setting  -Dio.netty.allocator.useCacheForAllThreads=false had no effects.
Security Breach - password passed in exceptions.When an exception is thrown upon the AUTH command the exception contains the actual password as a param. This happens because LogHelper.toString called by RedisConnection.async nowadays accepts a "Object..." all the time, and LogHelper redacts the password only when a single object of the type CommandData is passed.
RMapCache eviction fails if process is terminated.I am using RMapCache to handle my distributed collections.When adding to the map, i use:So the key should expire after 20 seconds. This works, if the process is not terminated before the expiration timestamp. However, if the process dies for any reason, the key never expires.By observing this behavior, I have concluded that is the Java process that makes the Key expire. I would like Redisson to use Redis EXPIRE behavior for keys, so that the Java process is not responsible for expiring the key.This way, i will know for sure that the key will expire after the given time, even if for any reason the java process dies.Is this possible to do with Redisson?

Poor performance when using ReplicatedMode.Hi,For a while I've been using a single redis instance, therefore configured in SingleServer mode. Recently I decided to add a read replica into the mix for failover protection. Also assumed I would get a performance boost too... I was wrong!Below are some performance results. The test writes 10,000 objects into the cache with a random key. The test runs 10 times. For each key, I measure the time it takes to do a GET & PUTASYNC.The results are really surprising;The ReplicatedMode is MUCH slower than SingleServer using the default read mode.Changing to MASTER_SLAVE read mode helps, but it's still much slower with lots of spikes in the perf.Average is pretty good and the max is usually much less than 100ms.ReplicatedServers Mode.Average is quite a bit slower here but the max is massively slower!ReplicatedServers Mode using ReadMode.MASTER_SLAVE.Things get interesting here. Averages are all over the place, low as 1.9ms but high as 25.7ms. Max is generally lower, but it's still eratic.So, my questions are;Is this expected? I assumed replicated mode would be a performance improvement.Is there anything I can do to improve this. If I can get the replicated performance similar to single server that would be ideal, if possible. Right now the only option might be to not have a read replica which will be a real shame.Thanks in advance!Details.
CommandAsyncService produces RedisExceptions without a causal exception.RedisException stack traces from CommandAsyncService should contain a causal exception wrapped inside a Redis exception. At least that's what I would expect from this code in CommandAsyncService:I'm seeing a small number of sporadic RedisException stack traces without any causal information. This is all there is:Looking at the redisson code, I can't quite see how we would end up with an unsuccessful future without an exception.Is the causal exception swallowed somewhere?Are there conditions under which the future can fail without an exception?Steps to reproduce or test case.No test case unfortunately.This happens very sporadically, and only under load.

Does redisson use of jackson for serialization of a custom class annotates said class with JsonTypeInfo?According to Redissons documentation, it uses Jackson as JSON codec, using the @Class field to store the type.How does redisson set this configuration to jacksons object mapper? The only way i know is to decorate the class with the @JSonTypeInfo annotation, but this means that for every serialization / deserialization of the class, the @Class field will and needs to exist.I have a rest service that receives a json of a custom class without the @Class annotation, so i cannot afford jackson to always require the @Class field in deserialization.Will using said custom class in a RBucket cause my custom class to be annotated by JsonTypeInfo, if not, how does redisson manage to set that for some deserializations of a custom class a @Class field is required, but for others it is not?
RBucket does not support GetAndSet with a TTL for the set operation.I want to do a get and a set simultaneously but the getandset() method of the RBucket does not support setting a ttl for the key.I have tried to use an RTransaction and obtaining the bucket from the transaction instead of the client, but calling get() on the bucket always returns the value.Is there any way to perform a get and a set with ttl using the RTransaction for RBucket types?
Error deserializing RBucket with jackson Codec.I am using lots of RBuckets which serialize with Jackson Codec:        config.setCodec( new JsonJacksonCodec());In a stress test environment, sometimes happens that i get an error when asking for the value of a bucket, and i see that the problem is in the deserialization of the JSON:Any idea what is happening? The error seems to be totally random and non deterministic. Redisson handles serialization and deserialization entirely, so i do not know how an invalid character is being stored in Redis.Is there a way i could attach to a listener to gain some insight on this process? Something like being notified right before saving the bucket to redis, so i can check for that character (CHAR-1) or when reading?

Improvement for YAML Support: Read from a child yaml block.Current YAML support expects to provide separate YAML file which has redis configs only. But in real world, redis clients will be used with in a  main application(which also bootstraped from a main yaml file).  It's convenient to support creating Config from a block of some main yaml file as follows.Even now I can get ClusterServersConfig created pointing to the clusterServersConfig block as in following example, but Config API does now allow to pass a ClusterServerConfig.Suggestion:If you can make Config class's following method public, then users can inject ClusterServersCondfig(or any other type) and create a Config object from a existing big yaml file.
Pub/sub subscriptions lost on master failover.When a primary node fails over, redisson appears to detect this and correctly pick up the new primary.

I was able to reproduce using.Here's a log from the client during the failover:

Tomcat Session Manager issue in Load Balance environment with redMode MEMORY.We have a 2 instances of tomcat running in front of apache (with sticky session).We have a single redis instance and we are using the redisson tomcat 8 session manager (setup in the context.xml in the /conf dir). Version redisson-tomcat-8-3.7. Tomcat version 8.0.32.This is similar to bug #1311 . We have a session timeout of 30mins.What is happening:User logs onto instance 1, session created.User uses session on instance 1.Apache loadbalancers the request over to instance 2 (perhaps load was too great on instance1)New session created on instance 2 and loaded with session info via redis, user carries on without loosing session. All good so far.15 mins later user makes another request and apache loadbalancers back to instance 1. User carries on without issue.User keeps using their session on instance 1.7)On instance 2 the session timesout after 30 mins. This then invalidates the session on instance 1 even though the user is still using it and user looses session . This is the problem.It seems that  in RedissonSessionManager.java -> startInternal() -> onMessage() when receiving a AttributesPutAllMessage is NOT updating the timing on the session (at least in readMode MEMORY)  and then tomcat MangerBase times the session out. I can see session values session:lastAccessedTime and session:thisAccessedTime are sent in the map, however debugging into superSetAttribute() on Tomcat 8 does NOT update these member variables, and therefore the session timesout.I made a local patch to test my thoery by calling session.superEndAccess() instead:This now works as expected. However I'm not sure this is the best implementation and looking for your guidence/fix. This is consistently reproducable.

Redisson sessions that never dies - missing TTL.For the record, we are using Redisson 3.10.4 with Redisson Tomcat 8.In som cases we end up with shallow sessions without a TTL that fills up Redis. These junk sessions should probably not end up in Redis in the first place, but due to our complex application that is the situation for now. Anyway, there should be a guard in the Redis code that avoid sessions beeing created without a TTL. I'll explain why this happens and a suggestion for a solution which we are running ourselves in production.This particular case arises when a request includes a session id which is neither stored locally in Tomcat or in Redis and it is immediately abandoned(no more interaction with the session). Then the public Session findSession(String id)  code in RedissonSessionManager is triggered, it doesn't find the session of course, but a new empty session is created and persisted in Redis where they stay forever. The fix is obviously to setMaxInactiveInterval on the session, which we in fact have done. But to accomplish this we have overriden the default RedissonSessionManager with out own custom RedissonSessionManager and added only session.setMaxInactiveInterval(getContext().getSessionTimeout() * 60), reusing the logic used when creating new sessions. Ideally we wan't to avoid having a custom RedissonSessionManager to solve what should probably be part of the default RedissonSessionManager.@mrniko Could you please add this task to the next milestone?

Whats the meaning of freeConnectionsAmount?Hi.When our server reach some load we are getting this errors from Redis:I have read a lot about this error in the issues but i cannot find how to solve :-(, what i have notice is that the freeConnectionsAmount is equals to 1, can this means that our code is unable to create more connections and this is what is causing the problem? I also see that freeConnectionsCounter=64 so this means that there are free connections?Redisson version: 3.10.1.Best Regards.

 ERROR CommandDecoder - Unable to decode data. reply: $85998717.I am doing a POC on Redisson. We added 600K  records as List into Rmap.While doing dlMap.get(key); it is causing the above error.The good thing is , it is working fine if users list is 150k.UserList is a list of Users object. is there a way i can get rid of this issue. or even better if i can get a particular user object say having user.getId = 181062.Thanks for the help in advance.

Password support for sentinel.conf requirepass config option.Sentinel support for authentication with password was added in Redis 5. Redisson will authenticate to Redis Sentinel's started with requirepass <password.here> in sentinel.conf.  The work around for now is to simply have the sentinel's not run in protected mode even if Redis Master/Slave instances have password requirements.  This works, however when auth is required on the sentinel nodes (as set by sentinel.conf requirepass <foo.bared.blahblahblah>) themselves, RedissonClient cannot perform commands to the sentinel nodes (Sentinel Sentinels, Sentinel Master, yada yada)Commit adding authentication support for sentinels: is that RedissonClient sends the auth with a password value that's set in a config.Redisson does not appear to authenticate with the redis password stored in BaseConfig, and there doesn't appear to be a place to add one in the SentinelConfig.  On Spring boot application with redis password set and requirepass in sentinel.conf, startup has the following error:Steps to reproduce or test case.Start a Redis Master, Replica, and Sentinels all with requirepass set to some value, then attempt to get RedissonClient with SentinelServersConfig set up, setting password to whatever your password is, master name to whatever your master name is, and your nodes as appropriate.Due to sensitive nature of passwords, names etc, these will remain abstracted in my configuration snippet here.  None of these values are null, they are all set via a configuration setting.

WriteRedisConnectionException HANDLING.handle org.redisson.client.WriteRedisConnectionException for example same way as others in spring CacheErrorHandler.I try sentinel, master-slave and also single server redisson config. In each configuration is problem when cached method with sync=true and connection to redis server is broken or redis server is down.IF WE USE method without SYNC=true then exception is similar but is HANDLED by org.springframework.cache.interceptor.CacheErrorHandler and is behavior OK.
Possibility of broken connections on the pool.When using a fixed connection pool of min=64 and max=64 to every node (masters and slaves) on cluster config. Redisson is able to open a healthy connection pool of 64 to each of the nodes.It seems that on some cases when our app container (dockerized app) starts there might be some network/warm up issues (also seen by getting a few CLUSTER_NODES and CLUSTER_INFO timeouts during startup) leads to some connections on the pool to be broken. No issue is easily observed at low traffic after but after increasing a bit the load, it seems some requests to those instances (we deployed 20 instances and 2 ended up like this) fail with timeouts. This doesn't seem to happen to instances that started and opened all the connections properly at startup but seems this faulty startup instances remain in a broken state and do not recover and/or re-create those broken connections.On any case, as said, this only happens on those cases during startup. So that's our primary hypothesis. If any logic can be put into place to deal with potential broken connections on the pool or some monitoring of the pool we can enable or some config we could do differently. Please advice.example timeout:Steps to reproduce or test case.

Redis Cache Read Latency Increase with Time.We are using ElastiCache Redis (version 5.0.3) as our cache server and Redisson 3.8 as our client.Here are the write and read code.We find that with time on, the cache read latency will increase, for example,after the deployment, in the first 3 days, the latency is almost same, keep 2 to 3 milliseconds.in the next 3 days, the latency can increase to 20 milliseconds. It will keep increasing.This latency increase has no relation with traffic.At the same time, I find that that the redis cluster cache miss provided by AWS (The number of unsuccessful read-only key lookups in the main dictionary. This is derived from keyspace_misses at Redis INFO.) will increase from the very beginning (after the deployment).We can do deployment to fix the issue.After the deployment, the latency and cache miss go to normal.Please help me to fix the issue.Thanks.

Redisson no longer supports auth in sentinel clusters older than Redis 5.0.1.As of version 3.10.5, Redisson no longer supports sentinel clusters that have a master password but no sentinel password. The commit 4ee3074 changed the MasterSlaveConnectionManager to set the sentinel and master password to the same thing so if they differ the client will be unable to connect. This breaks any software using Redisson that connects to a sentinel Redis cluster with a password that is older than 5.0.1, when sentinel auth was added.A potential solution would be to add a sentinelPassword field to the SentinelServersConfig class representing the sentinel password and have the existing password field only represent the master password. It would change the meaning of the existing password field as well as force the MasterSlaveConnectionManager to be aware of the sentinel password, so that fix might require some thought from someone more familiar with the codebase than I am.Redisson should be able to connect to a sentinel cluster with the following configurations:A master password but no sentinel password.A sentinel password but no master password.Different passwords for the master and sentinels.The same password for both the master and sentinels.No password for either.Only the last two are currently supported in Redisson. Redis as of version 5.0.1 supports all of them and before version 5.0.1 supports 1 and 5.Attempting to connect to a cluster with a master password but no sentinel password and giving the client the master password results in this error:org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException: At least two sentinels should be defined in Redis configuration! SENTINEL SENTINELS command returns empty result!This does not cause an error in 3.10.4. The same error occurs if the master and sentinel passwords differ and the client is given the master password.Attempting to connect to a cluster with a sentinel password but no master password and giving the client the sentinel password results in this error:The same error occurs if the master and sentinel passwords differ and the client is given the sentinel password.Steps to reproduce or test case.Start a redis master/slave cluster with requirepass and masterauth set to password.Start 3 sentinels with auth-pass set to password and either requirepass set to differentpassword or no requirepass set at all.Set the password in the sentinel config to either the master password password or, if set, the sentinel password differentpassword.Attempt to connect to the Redis cluster.

Reference leak on timeout of async operations in 3.10.3+.Timeouts of async operations should not produce reference leaks.Timeouts of async operations appear to produce a reference leak, in the form of a listener to the shutdown promise associated with the connection manager.Steps to reproduce or test case.Perform async Redisson operation (e.g., BlockingQueue.pollAsync) with a short timeout in a loop (allowing the timout to expire). Observe growth in memory usage over time, and/or inspect with VisualVM or similar.issue appears to have been introduced in 3.10.3 in CommandAsyncService.handleBlockingOperations, around line 975. When the AtomicBoolean "skip" flag was introduced, a statement removing the listener from the shutdown promise on timeout was removed. I believe removing the listener would eliminate the leak.

Explanation of Config connection/thread settings.I am fairly new to Redisson and had a few questions I would like clarified. I read through the documentation, but the description of config settings weren't very helpful to me.For every RedissonClient, a connection pool is created with a set min idle size and max size. How is each connection exactly used? Does each operation use a connection? Are ops batched into one request and sent through the connection?When we set the threads parameter (setThreads), what are these threads used for? Connecting to redis? Deserializing?When we set the nettyThreads parameter, what are these threads used for?What is relationship between nettyThreads, threads, and connectionPool? What are important things to keep in mind while tuning these parameters?Thank you!

Why calling releaseConnection(entry) every time when a RedisConnection is created?My understanding is that the counter in AsyncSemaphore should decrement by 1 when a new connection is added to the pool however by calling releaseConnection(entry) in the runnable,  the counter is added by 1, which means after minimal idle size of connections are created, the counter will be the same as it was before the pool is initialized.Please help me understand this, as I think more than max pool size of connections would be allowed to exist in the pool, since counter is not decremented after the pool's initialization.

Permanent kv (ttl=-1) was found in Redis while using Tomcat Session Manager.All the timeout kv will disappear automaticlly.Some permanent kv still alive, and whose ttl are -1.Steps to reproduce or test case.Using Tomcat Session Manager normally.Details.First of all, after using Tomcat Session Manager for a long time, I found many kv in Redis and their ttl are all -1.Then I cleared Redis and did a simple test, first I put config content to tomcat in context.xml, then open a page but not did login action. I found a ttl=-1 kv.And second I did login with user name and password, I found another kv, but the ttl is session timeout second and was reducing automaticlly.After a while (longer then timeout config value), it disappered. But another kv (ttl=-1) was still alive.In my expected case, all the kv will disappered automaticlly. That is to say, after a long long time and if nobody do login action, the Redis server will be empty.Do anybody has some advise for this issue?

usage of weak ReferenceCacheMap on org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService#CODECS  may cause frequent recreation of code.Hi,We noticed recently there are a lot of org.nustaq.serialization.FSTConfiguration instances around in our jvm service(with redisson 3.6 installed and FstCodec enabled).But according to the comment in the javadoc, construction of org.nustaq.serialization.FSTConfiguration is very expensive, which should be cached and reused.After some digging in redisson's code, I get some clue, it may be caused by the implementation type of org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService#CODECS . By design, codec construction should be limited, mostly old ones from the ConcurrentHashMap stored in the ReferenceCacheMap should get returned. But since CODECS is a weak reference cache map, the ConcurrentHashMap is possible to get removed by GC. And since there is only one possible strong reference to the ConcurrentHashMap, which is a local variable in org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService#getCodec,  the possibility of CODECS getting cleared during a GC event is very large.the declaration and usage of org.redisson.command.CommandAsyncService#CODECS  is included in the following snippet.
UpdateValve should be installed only once, remove MessageListener from topic when SessionManager stopInternal is invoked.UpdateValve valve should be installed only once for tomcat pipeline but if there are multiple web application each one will instantiate a new RedissonSessionManager and each startInternal() will install it's own copy of the UpdateValve, more over the UpdateValve  have back reference to RedissonSessionManager, so remove this reference in order to have only one UpdateValve installed for the tomcat pipeline and allow proper RedissonSessionManager garbage collection.When we have Redisson client set in JNDI which is shared between web applications we need to remove MessageListener from the topic when web application is deinstalled during stopInternal method of RedissonSessionManager.Each web app will create it's own RedissonSessionManager instance which will result in multiple UpdateValve instances installed into tomcat pipeline.MessageListener is not removed from redisson topic which will cause web application class loader memory leak as MessageListener have reference to codecToUse which in turn have reference to application class loader.
Subscribe timeout - after master re-election.Please delete this issue, needs more work before filing. I cant delete myself.see #2181.
Subscribe Timeout Exceptions - After master Re-election.None, or fewer Exceptions (just during failover period)After a master re-election (and not otherwise) a constant percentage (about 1%) of the requests fail with this exception until the Redisson client is re-initialised manually with a pod bounce.Steps to reproduce or test case.I'm running 3 redis (master, slave, slave) alongside 3 sentinels.I'm running a constant load of requests through a redisson client which can run indefinitely without any issue. .When I introduce a chaos script to trigger a failure of the master and thus a master re-election I start to see the errors, yet only for a very small percentage of the requests (but that percentage remains constant indefinitely until a manual restart of the redisson client happens)Each request acquires and releases an RLock with a chance of collision with another request being 1 in 100.If I lower the collision probability to be 1 in 10000 this problem almost completely disappears to the point where I lose only perhaps a single request, during the failover period (which is the expected behaviour for the higher collision case also)

add default entries in MANIFEST.MF file and extra Build-Time entry as well.Currently there is no way to tell when a jar file has been build - This feature request is to add Build-Time manifest entry so that we could tell when it was build/rebuild as often if release version is not changed (e.g. providing patches via rebuild of the master code) once the modified version of the jar file is created we can't tell if it contains the fixes or not by simply having a file inside the jar to tell us when it has been build. Also some of the jars that are created do not have the default implementation entries and/or specification entries.Each jar to have default implementation/specification entries and have a build time - optionally if we have git branch / commit into MANIFEST.MF would be beneficial as well.

Microsoft Azure and Redisson: Unable to init enough connections amount.Context.We are in the process of migrating to Microsoft Azure and are planning to make use of the Azure Redis Cache. Because of this, I am in the process of investigating Redisson and have been for the most part impressed by the performance and feature set.However, I have been running into this intermittent issue for a few days now. Every now and again, when the application starts up, Redisson will throw an error, telling me that it's only able to initialise 31 of 32 connections. My experiments with Lettuce didn't seem to run into anything similar to this.Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions on things to look into to resolve this? Is there something particular about Azure Redis Cache that might need to be configured? Does Redisson need all 32 connections or would reducing the required number potentially resolve this?Successfully connects to Redis every time.

HGET implementation in Redisson.Apologies if this is something simple that I've missed out.Have been trying to figure this out for a while but can't.Trying to simply get the value associated with field in the hash stored at key as described in the documentation for HGET.The code used is.However, it seems like this implementation fetches all values stored in all fields in 'myHash' instead of just the value stored in field 'a'. Unsure if this fetching of values happens during redisson.getMap ( More likely ) or map.get()Redisson issues only one HGET and retrieves only the value of field 'a' in hash 'myhash'.Redisson seems to be fetching values of all fields in 'myhash'.
Can't execute SENTINELS commands, only happens to the last sentinel server.I'm using Redis with 1 master and 2 slaves, watched over by 3 sentinels on 3 ports 8359, 8360 and 8361 from a single node. When executing through redisson the program works perfectly fine except that every now and then it spews out this error:This doesn't really affect anything so far, the sentinels still send data properly to the clients but I have ever wondered what might be the cause of this? It only happens to the last port 8361, the two other ports are unaffected albeit on the same node.

RMap write-behind service may execute "put" and "delete" in different order.The order of tasks is not preserved, which is pretty critical if the same key was both added/updated and deleted. Looks like tasks are accumulated in two separate batches, each one is flushed once full. If there are no more incoming tasks, then "deletes" are always executed first.Check sample code in "steps to reproduce".In the sample code below I'd expect it to print:Btw, setting batch size to "1" fixes the issue, which makes sense - all tasks are carried out with delay but exactly when received, so the order is preserved.But without batching "write-behind" feature isn't really that useful.Steps to reproduce or test case.

Unable to configure Redis to keyspace notifications.Hello, I'm using Redisson and it works fine in dev environment because I use default config of redis. But when I deploy my app in stage environment it failed to start. The error message is "Unable to configure Redis to keyspace notifications" and I think this is caused by disabling the CONFIG command in the Redis of stage environment. The command CONFIG was disabled by renaming to another wired name so we cannot use that command. But when my springboot app starts, redisson try to set the config keyspace notifications, is there any purpose of this behavior? If I don't want to use event subscription, how can I disable this feature to avoid this Exception?Thanks in advance.

Session behaviour mismatch - Redis + AFTER_REQUEST.Redisson session manager should return actual value of value persisted to session.Redisson returns null for every value previously saved.Steps to reproduce or test case.but accroding to my opinion, it should return "abcd".If I use readMode = MEMORY, it is somehow working but currently, I´m experiencing issues with synchronization => getting outdated session / not latest data. So I tried to use readMode = "REDIS". I would expect session to be on every request fully loaded from Session, during request are made to the memory object and at the end, it should be push to Redis.Maybe it is not a bug, not sure, whether it is intended or not. Otherwise, could you advise how to solve? Or tune config somehow to eleminate outdated session data?

How to properly implement rate limiter hasPermits.Using Redisson latest.We have queues with messages in them to be sent to 3rd party APIs. We are using the rate limit functionality to prevent 429s from the 3rd party APIs. When we do get a 429, we re-queue the message and try again later. After several retries, it ends up in a DLQ. To prevent this we wrote a hasPermits method on a wrapper around RRateLimiter and RAtomicLong where the atomic long points to the "{" + rateLimiterName + "}:value" key. We then use hasPermits to test whether we should poll the queue for messages or not.We are now on our 3rd implementation of this method and want to double check it for correctness and/or ask that it be added to the RRateLimter interface.Our 1st implementation simply checked RAtomicLong::get > 0 . This failed because an uninitialized RRateLimter did not have the corresponding atomic long key and always returned 0.2nd implementation:If false we called RRateLimter::tryAcquire(1) because tryAcquire would create the atomic long if it was not present with the correct value and TTL.If tryAcquire succeeded, we put a token back with RAtomicLong:: incrementAndGet. This caused an edge case where the TTL expired, the key was deleted by Redis and the incrementAndGet created a key without a TTL.  The value would then get decremented to 0 by the next tryAcquire and the rate limiter would never show any available tokens. This probably could have been prevented by using a Lua script or a batch/pipeline.Our 3rd implementation seems correct, but we want to double check since we've had so many issues. We now:if -2 (not present), then return true as the next call to RRateLimter::tryAcquire will (re)create the atomic long with the correct number of permits.if -1 (key present, but no TTL), we set the TTL using the configured rate interval. This step would not normally be necessary except to fix the bad atomic long keys created by implementation 2 above.return RAtomicLong::get > 0.We think this 3rd implementation is now correct, but could be improved by using a Lua script or batch/pipeline to perform the check in a single round trip to Redis. Any feedback would be appreciated. If this could be added to the RRateLimter interface, that would be even better.Thanks.

Prevent "split brain" scenario with HA-proxy.With the use of HAProxy server, Redis Sentinels can be configured to allow for automatic failover between the master and slave Redis replica instances for high availability.HAProxy comes with built-in TCP health check feature for Redis to perform an automatic failover. To avoid having to change Redis IP/Port in the front-end client application after each failover, I have setup HAProxy with the TCP health check to test if a Redis instance is a master or slave. This setup is needed to make sure it only proxy connections to an active master instance. More Info here.Running in the replicated mode, this causes split brain and redisson fails to start with an error "Multiple masters detected".Redisson should to be able to connect to the ha-proxy ports and run without split brain.Steps to reproduce or test case.Use HAProxy and Redis Sentinel for automatic failover.Replicated Servers Config with nodeAddresses of ha proxy port.

Redisson netty thread consumes ~100% CPU with RedisTimeoutException.Hi,The issue being faced is that redisson netty thread consumes ~100% CPU and when a redis operation is performed we get RedisTimeoutException.In the current set up,3 redis sentinels and 3 redis servers.2 pods with our application that uses redisson client.Out of the 2 pods only one pod seems to have this issue.The pattern of the issue is that it runs with .1% CPU utilisation for few days and,suddenly there is increase in CPU usage which hits 100%. Once it reached 100% all redis operation fail with RedisTimeoutException.The CPU utilisation drops down back to .1% if the pod is restarted and the issue doesnt appear for few days.If the pod is not restarted CPU utilisation continues to be at 100% throughout.This is happening irrespective of the load even for as low as 1 request per minute.The exception being faced post high CPU usage is.Redisson netty threads should not consumer 100% CPU, even if it does should release it eventually.And we should not be having RedisTimeoutException.

Jackson mapping for Config raising java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException with Java.Reading properties from a config file and mapping them with com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.convertValue() to a Redisson Config to be working fine.It seems like with Java 9 module system using reflection is not as safe as before. We are running Java 11 and the following exception is raised when using com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.convertValue() to create a Redisson Config from a Map (properties loaded from a config file).The exception is raised when trying to create a ClassLoader (which is needed in the Redisson Codec) via reflection.I would like to know if there's any other way to easily create a Redisson Config based on a config file without having to hardcode every property.If you have something in mind which can be implemented here to avoid this kind of issues we are more than happy to contribute a PR.Steps to reproduce or test case.We still can't reproduce this with a clear example, in some of our Java 11 apps we can convert to a Redisson Config, but in other ones the above exception is raised. So we are still trying to figure out how we can reproduce this consistently.That said, the piece of code is something like this:

ExecutorOptions.taskRetryInterval not working as expected.When submitting task with taskRetryInterval option set, the task should run on the next available Redisson executor node when the original executor node was killed.The task is not retried on the next available worker. Also when the worker node is started again it will run duplicate task on all the available worker nodes.Steps to reproduce or test case.Submit JobA and then start 2 instance of the Worker lets say Worker1 and Worker2. When Worker1 is running JobA kill that worker, now the Worker2 should try to run the JobA after the taskRetryInterval, but it does not. Now start Worker1 again, Redisson will duplicate the task run on both Worker1 and Worker2.

RedisOutOfMemoryException caused inconsistency.redisson and redis are used ONLY as cache by spring @Cacheable(value="xy", key="ab") annotations.  TTL is set to 10min. no manual access or manual redisson commands are written in code.after catch RedisOutOfMemoryException redisson evicts old keys to make more space, because redis cannot handle outOfMemory due to redisson creates key "xy" that represents whole cache name and ttl is not set for this key. Value of this key is "map" that contains cache our keys "ab" and cached values. There exists also other redis key with prefix redisson__timeout__set:{xy} that holds TTL.after RedisOutOfMemoryException there is inconsistency that stored records are alive and is returned from cache after 5 days even we have TTL only 10min. Maybe because redisson first put value to xy cache and next put TTL value to redisson__timeout__set:{xy} cache. if write to redisson__timeout__set:{xy} caused OOM exception then record in xy cache will stay alive forever.Steps to reproduce or test case.set redis max memory to low value and store bigger data to cache.

Graceful handling of failures for Redisson Tomcat Session Manager.I am using Redisson's Tomcat9 session manager going against Azure Redis Cache.with readMode=MEMORY and updateMode=DEFAULT .This is mainly for session failover in case a server fails. Sessions are sticky, and so during normal operation, all session reads should be local within Tomcat.Occasionally all of our Tomcat instances experience Netty timeout errors and requests to Redis fail.  This causes a complete failure of the application, as sessions are unavailable. This failure seems unnecessary, since the session data is available in local Tomcat memory and is not dependent on Redis (except in the case of failover)Is there any way to get Redisson session manager to circuit break if calls to Redis fail or time out, and fall back to using session data from local memory ? The exception is below. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!Redisson Session Manager should fail gracefully and fall back to local memory if Redis calls fail, and Tomcat requests should succeed.All Tomcat requests that use the http session data fail.Steps to reproduce or test case.Issue is intermittent, but occurs when calls to Netty time out.

RRateLimiter does not provide way to overwrite config.RRateLimiter does not have a setRate/setRateAsync method.It only has trySetRate/trySetRateAsync methods, so once a rate-limiter's config is persisted to Redis, it cannot be overwritten.Invoking RRateLimiter.trySetRate twice with different rate-limiter configuration values does not overwrite, since it uses HSETNX instead of HSET operation.Steps to reproduce or test case.There is no way to overwrite the existing "myRateLimiter" with a different rate, besides modifying the rate limiter name.

After restarted a slave node of cluster, redisson could not recover from "RedisConnection is not active" exception.The redisson should reconnect and query without exceptions, after the slave restarted.By contrast, the servers using redisson v3.7.3 recovered as expected.Steps to reproduce or test case.The redis cluster are composed of 3 masters with 3 slaves.I did cluster failover on the slave, after the master and slave switched successfully, i did shutdown and restarted the server. After the operations, the redisson threw exceptions when queried the restarted redis node, and could not recovered automatically in half an hour.Redis version.Other problems.After master-slave switch and restart slave node, I found all redisson(v2.13.1 and v3.7.3) connections increased significantly(almost twice as normal connections), and config timeout set xxx was useless. When i restarted the servers, the redisson connections were back to normal. So is there a reason that redisson do no release idle connections for a long time?

Calling RSet.getSize() returns the correct size of set, but then set is empty afterward.Call RSet.getSize() returns set size of N, and a subsequent call to RSet.iterator(batchSize) allows you to iterate through all N items.Call RSet.getSize() returns set size of N, and a subsequent call to RSet.iterator(batchSize) returns an iterator that has no items to iterate through.  Without (first) getting the size, the iterator will iterate through the set of N elements.  For some reason, getting the size (first) makes the set appear to be empty, and there seems to be no method to "reset" to the head of the set, if this is, indeed, what is happening.  Another detail that may also be notable is that, each time I restart my application, RSet.size() returns the expected size, so the data is not being removed with a call to get the cardinality of the set.Steps to reproduce or test case.Get a set by calling RSet testSet = RedissonClient.getSet("testSet");Add items to the set with testSet.addAll(Arrays.asList("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"));Get the set size with int testSetSize = RSet.size();The size of testSetSize == 5.Get an iterator with testSet.iterator(5);Attempt to iterate over the set, but there will be no items to iterate over.
example code to connect to redis in Kubernetes setup.In my Kubernetes setup, REDIS pods get created as following..So 1 master and few slaves.Output of "kubectl get svc" is like:I want to connect to both master-slave via Raddison client.I'm not sure how though because there are like following ways!This is what i am confused with.Could you please provide a sample code on how best to connect to Redis with master slave configuration?master could become slave and vice versa so how dynamically Raddision would take care of this switch?IPs of service needs to be configured or IPs of pods?

Reads failing on replication mode when attempting to read immediately after write.Hello @mrniko.We are facing an issue when using redisson with Elasticache with replication.We are writing some 100K key value pairs to a map and then renaming it. Then we immediately attempt to read the same. It fails and redisson reports that the key does not exist.Note that we have default values of read mode (SLAVE) and scan interval (1000ms) . Can you please suggest if changing to MASTER_SLAVE read mode can help in this. Also are there any configurations on redisson that we can try with.Thanks,Yash.
Migrate data from a Redis cluster to an other.I want to migrate data from an old Redis cluster to a new one programmatically, so I did this :The problem with this, is that I when I do RBucket::get, Redisson try to decode the value with a class that is not necessarily in the classpath (because that was set by an other microservice).Is there a way to disable decoding in Redisson ? Or a better way to do this ?

Dynamic Lock IDs.More a question of use case then an issue -- unless the answer is "Cant do that".I have some small 'microservice' type processes (running in docker ECS on AWS).  One thing they do is pocess S3 filels on change notificaiton.  Im subscribing to a SNS topic which then gets routeed and load balnced to an avoaible node.   For some operations I want to 'lock' a segment of code identifyed by the S3 Path -- Like a pool of ionotify workers.Since the spae of possible key values is large and unknown upfront I cant pre-allocate locks.Rather when a node gets an event I want it to 'lock' such that other nodes if they get the ssame event can be (cooperatively) kept from operrating on the same file at th3es ame time.(inthe same process or a differnt process) In a period of an hour -- hundreds or thousands of unique keys/files may occur.  The operations while locked may vary from ms to munltiple minutes.  I realize I will likely have to treat these cases differnt -- (keep a map of locked node)My question is this.  I tried a 'simplistic' approch which carates a NEW lock structure on eveyr eent, passing it the unique IID vailel Then after 'work' is complete releasing the lock.Other apps may be doing the same thing and they should block in some way sothey dont both operatioe on the same file.   This seems to work --but I dont know if its effective.For exmaple -- how 'expensive' is it to allodate a new lock.If I simply 'unlock a loc does that delete it from Redis ?   What do I need to do to 'release' the lock  fully?  THen assumign all went well -- what is the latency to examime a lock ot sed if its sill in use ?There will be hundreds of uniquie Ids --  Is there a better dataa type for this ?  Maybe a combonation of a Map and Lock ?Any suggestions welcom.
PublishSubscribeService#freePubSubConnections to be per cluster node?Subscribe/connect to the cluster node specific to the topic.Great chance to subscribe/connect to wrong cluster node.Steps to reproduce or test case.2-1. subscribe to topic 1, correct cluster node connected/subscribed.2-2. subscribe to topic 2 from different cluster node, but still node of topic 1 is connected/subscribed.When "freeEntry == null", PublishSubscribeService#connect does the right thing by locating cluster node via topic.Nonetheless, when "freeEntry != null", topic 2 of above reproduction would use connection to topic 1 cluster node. For example of cluster of 5 nodes, we experienced 80% chance topic 2 appeared successfully subscribed, but never notified.Maybe PublishSubscribeService#freePubSubConnections can be per cluster node ?Additionally, ClusterConnectionManager#calcSlot parses key out of "{KEY}..." to locate cluster node, any chance to extend it to support Redis format of "keyspace*:KEY" such as the one from redisson/src/test/java/org/redisson/RedissonTopicTest.java please ?More additionally, any chance to extend ClusterConnectionManager to subscribe/connect to all cluster nodes for non-key based topics "__keyevent@*" such as the ones from redisson/src/main/java/org/redisson/RedissonObject.java & redisson/src/main/java/org/redisson/spring/session/RedissonSessionRepository.java please ?

Multiple tomcat instance behind a load balancer.Hi, We are trying to host the application in 2 tomcat instance hosted behind a application gateway(load balancer in AWS). In both tomcat instance we have configured redisson session manager with required jars in tomcat/lib.Below is the context xml entry:Scenario:Bring up instance 1 and login to app, go to a screen and do some changes and don't save yet. This ensures we have logged in to instance 1.Bring up instance 2 now. Bring down the instance 1. Try to do save on the application now and app throws below error.Basically we are trying to aim for zero downtime with these 2 instances, so that if one instance goes down, other instance should be able to pick up the application state and continue the execution without user needing to re-login.Please help us with the above error.

Redisson Session Manager session attributes problem.We want to use Redisson Session Manager as a Tomcat Session Manager. It is essential that Redisson is configured as a shared instance in Tomcat since plugins that need access to a shared Session will be used. We found a behavior that could potentially indicate a bug in the session management.A simplified diagram of our system is shown in the following figure.The repository with the test project based on Spring Boot is here:All apps should use the same shared Session which is resolved based on JSESSIONID cookie. The Session should contain attributes with latest values that also include session scoped beans.When the readMode property of Manager configuration in context.xml is set to REDIS, behavior seems to be as expected (see value of session_attribute_count in response or logs which is incremented by 1 for every request). But with REDIS read mode, session scoped beans are not stored as session attributes.However, if we change readMode to MEMORY, session scoped beans are stored as session attributes. Behavior is as expected if requests are sent to apps with the same context path (app-a in Tomcat 1 and Tomcat 2). When the request is sent to a different app (e.g. to app-b after being sent to app-a before), the second app (app-b) gets session attributes with values of the last request to the first app (app-a). If the request is sent to the first app (app-a) again, the session attribute values such as session_attribute_count will not continue from the values that the second app (app-b) had set. It also seems that session attributes that are added to the Session by the second app (such as session_attribute_app_b_value) are not available in the first app.Steps to reproduce or test case.Checkout repository with the test project.Build project with maven (mvn clean verify) to get war files at.Run docker-compose up from project root to set up stack with two Tomcats and Redis.Send requests to following endpoints (use the same session identifier) and inspect response and logs:Set different readMode property value (REDIS or MEMORY), redeploy docker stack, flush Redis and repeat step 4.

org.redisson.RedissonRemoteService caches and runs old versions of code.When submitting a task to a Redisson executor service the task is run in the state at the time of submit().Meaning: when i submit at task at some time X the code in the body of that task must execute exactly as it was at time X. If in the meantime the task code is modified and a new task is submitted at time Y, the code as it was submitted at time Y must be executed.Both code-at-time-X and code-at-time-Y are executed, randomly. This leads to unpredictable behaviour.Actually it seems more than one version of the code is cached and one is randomly picked for execution. This was proved by adding log statements.When restarting the app one of the versions would be executed.It's not documented how to clear this cache.Steps to reproduce or test case.BASIC:Create a Runnable that delegates part of the execution to a spring bean. (using the bean factory obtained from the spring context)Submit the Runnable in different versions, making sure it "prints" some different debugging output during execution, so it's possible to know which version is running.CASE 1: in one of the versions i changed the type of data i write to a redis list from string to a json object. BOTH versions were running! That means RANDOMLY some tasks would write a json and some others a string. The service somehow caches the code to run.CASE 2: the code caching became even more evident when the code was refactored (and one method eliminated). AFTER RESTART the executor service was expecting (for NEWLY submitted tasks) the deleted class to be present, and failed with a no-such-method-error.

Tomcat session expires causing session information in redis to be deleted.Background: The use Redis do session sharing. Session is currently shared by three projects.Problem: After logining in to a service, the service does not operate for a long time. When the timeout time set by the service tomcat is reached, even if other services are still in operation, there will be a forced exit. However, as long as one service is still in use, we do not want it to exit because one of the services has reached the timeout period.Is there a good solution?Thanks.
Provide classloader incase of FST so that it doesnt get the class loader from current thread.Do we have a way to provide class loader when using FST codec. we are facing classNotfound exceptions as the FSTConfiguration is picking up the current thread class loader which is used by RedisExecutor as shown in the below stack trace.Our proprietary classes are loaded from our class loader. So wanted to understand if we can set the classloader which is used by FSTCodec.

RedissonConnectionFactory does not shutdown RedissonClient on Spring destroy() call.Using Redisson PRO 3.11.6.The destroy() method on RedissonConnectionFactory is empty. When the RedissonConnectionFactory creates its own RedissonClient using the default constructor or the constructor that takes a Config as an argument, it should be responsible for calling shutdown() on the created RedissonClient. The RedissonClient is internal to the class and cannot be shutdown otherwise.To safely manage resources, we must use the constructor that takes a RedissonClient argument so that the client has an external reference that we can shutdown.

Subscriptions become zombies when network lost.Steps to reproduce or test case.Establish a connection to a single-server Redis.Subscribe to a topic using Redisson.Kill the network or restart Redis.Existing subscriptions should be closed when connection to Redis is lost.(and/or) subscriptions should re-subscribe when connection becomes possible again.The subscriptions are left in a zombie state where they're not connected and will never receive any data. Even if a new connection from the same JVM is established to Redis once it's available again, and it publishes data on the topic, the zombie subscription never receives it.It's ok that Redisson doesn't resubscribe when connection becomes available, but at the bare minimum it'd be super helpful if it closes the subscription or gave me an event to listen to or something so that I could handle it myself. I've tried all the options like keep-alive etc and there doesn't seem to be any workaround.

Memory Leak in SentinelConnectionManager ·39.Might be connected to #2120, but I wasn't too sure about that, so I decided to create a new issue instead.No memory leak?SentinelConnectionManager is leaking memory because it stores too many connections to the sentinels in the nodeConnections map.We are using a singleton Redisson instance for connecting to our replicated Redis instance (3 nodes, 3 sentinels). After running for some days, we are experiencing high GC times and OOM errors. Upon investigating the heap dump, we noticed that the SentinelConnectionManager stores nearly 50,000 connection to the same 3 sentinels in its nodeConnections map. However, the sentinels map itself only contains the expected 3 entries.I tried analyzing and reproducing the leak myself, but I wasn't too successful since I am not familiar with your code. Would be great if you could have a look what could cause such a behavior :)Unfortunately can't provide the heap dump since it might contain sensitive data.Steps to reproduce or test case.

Implement port mapping for sentinel and reported master.We are interested in running Sentinel behind a L4 proxy terminating TLS.  This sentinel will report a master at IP:master_port.  This master is behind a second L4 proxy terminating TLS on a port we plan to infer from the reported master_port.   Ideally, Redisson would offer Sentinel + Master over TLS, with the ability to configure a port mapping function to take master_port and translate it to the L4 proxy port terminating TLS in front of the master.   As an aside, our model does not require us to translate either the sentinel or master IP, but the Lettuce example below fully allows that.Here is the equivalent Lettuce 5.2.2 (due out 2/11/2020) code:Describe alternatives you've considered.Many.  Including putting the sentinel / master cluster behind an F5 load balancer terminating TLS and let the F5 choose the master.  Clients program to the F5 over plain Redis API over TLS.

Unable to initialize JCache using Redisson's config object.Expected behavior.When using Redisson with JCache with custom Redisson config, this custom config should be taken into account.From documentation:When executing Caching.getCachingProvider(), underneath config from default json config is used:Steps to reproduce or test case.Create a simple project with an empty redisson-jache.json(or without the file at all).Create a cache as explained in the documentation: 14.4 JCache API (JSR-107) implementation -> 3. Using Redisson's config object:
Cache performance is less when compared to map.We have performed an analysis on how map and cache performs with 50 KB and 1 MB data . As part of it, we observed map performs well compared to cache and also as data size increases the performance is degrading.But this states better performance with 6 bytes of data even though with open source redisson.Are there any configuration parameters which will help us to get better performance? If any, please provide the details of those parameters.Here are the benchmark performance numbers we got for 10000 entries :The redis configuration file, redisson configuration file and the sample program with which the performance numbers are taken are attached below.
Reading stream throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.Expected behavior.Reading Redis stream containing message without any field-value pairs should return successfully.Actual behavior.IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown:
How do i specify default permits when creating semaphore object with RMap.i am trying to create semaphore using below method from RMap interface.What is the default permits associated with this semaphore ?  i wanted to use Semaphore as an alternate to RLock , so i need a default max permit of 1. I see trySetPermits() method in RSemaphore class.. But is there a way to set default number of permits while creating Semaphore object without having to call trySetPermits() method.Without a provision to set a default number of permits, how would we achieve the scenario where multiple threads are trying to create a semaphore with same key ? Developer is forced to ensure that everytime a semaphore object is created for a given key,  trySetPermits() method need to be called exactly once in the entire lifecycle of application. Is my understanding right ? what happens in below scenario assuming events happen in same sequence as listed.thread 1 calls rmap.getsemaphore(key1);thread 1 calls trySetPermits(1); // number of availble permits is 1.thread 1 calls acquire();  // number of available permits to 0.thread 2 calls rmap.getsemaphore(key1);thread 2 calls trySetPermits(1); // Will this call sets the available permits to 1 again ? What would happen here?thread 2 calls acquire() // ideally thread 2 should not acquire permit.  What would happen here?
redisson.cache.ReferenceCacheMap causes OOM..Recently I used redisson 3.11.6 to r/w online redis on our server serivce, however, after it runs few days correctly something bad happens. Yep, it is awful OOM. I dumped server memory file and found that the biggest object is ReferenceCacheMap from redission (see on the pic of jprofiler).. I am really confused about why this object increased all the time and can't be released by GC, I will post some pics, hope anyone can help me to fix this. Thanks a lot.
How to know if RedissonMap is created at redis end.Is there a way to know if a map with given name is created at redis end. As per understanding, org.redisson.api.RedissonClient.getMap(java.lang.String name) always gives new RedissonMap and only creates interacts with redis when one does any map operations like get/put.Which means Using org.redisson.api.RedissonClient.getMap(java.lang.String name) will not send any request to redis ?So how can i know that if a map with given name already exists at redis end using any of the redisson apis?
I find a bug about Redisson,when I use it to set data into redis server.code:I want to set "" into redis server,but I find that this data become "",when I check redis server with tool——Redis Desktop Manager.
Add TTL on Comparator.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.We works with a lot of priority queue associated with Comparator (method trySetComparator). Result : Redisson create object in database like {akey}:redisson_sortedset_comparator, but never remove them.Describe the solution you'd like.Could you add a parameter to set a TTL on theses objects? perhaps in method trySetComparator?Describe alternatives you've considered.We have to delete these keys regularly, by hand.
Behaviour of RPermitExpirableSemaphores.few questions on RPermitExpirableSemaphore.what is the probability that permit id generated by  acquire() method returns same permit id for different or same key ? In otherwords is there a possiblity of collision of permit Ids in any scenario when acquiring the permit via this interface ?What happens to the permit when redisson node on which the permit was taken has crashed after permit ? Does the permit expire ? Does the LockWatchDogTimeout come into play here as well ?How does LockWatchDog Scheduler works ? Is this a single daemon thread or is there a TimerTask triggered for every lock request ? I am looking to understand implementation details of LockWatchDog . can we get a reference to the java class in Redisson Source code that is responsible for prolonging the expiry of keys.
Unable to decode data with NullPointer.No exceptions.Actual behavior.Error messages from CommandPubSubDecoder with messages saying:Use @EnableRedissonWebSession or tryLockAsync (or potentially anything that uses pubsub). Then configure redisson to decode in executor via isDecodeInExecutor. Under decent load it easily throws these exceptions.

Writing to RLocalCachedMaps is seeding the data to redis.Hello Nikita,In our application we are using RLocalCachedMaps to improve performance. In certain cases we want to persist the data locally and not send it to redis. For that we are writing to RLocalCachedMaps with the assumption that it would not seed the same data to redis. But we see in background that writes to RLocalCachedMaps are also sent to redis. We verified this using Monitor command on Redis Server.Can you please confirm if we have a way to prevent the writes to RLocalCachedMaps from going to redis. In case if there is any other Map that we should use, kindly let us know about that as well.Thanks.
RPermitExpirableSemaphore and RSemaphore.Does Redisson allows to release the semaphore  (RPermitExpirableSemaphore and RSemaphore) on different redisson client (different jvm) than the one on which permit was acquired ?
Client randomly timeout and won't recover.Hi, we have some redisson client timeout issue.We run a service with 30+ JVM instances. some instances' redisson client will randomly timeout (about 2 - 5 instances) and won't recover, but other instances still works fine.  The failed instances also use Jedis for some legacy feature, and it works fine too. We had to reboot the failed instances so it can recover.Redis servers are in cluster mode, we recently scaled our cluster from 3 masters, 3 slaves to 9 masters, 9 slaves, and the problem happens more often.Here's the timeout exception, hope it helps:
broken connections on the pool.Relate to #2043.Expected behavior.When using a fixed connection pool of min=64 and max=64 to every node (masters and slaves) on cluster config. Redisson is able to open a healthy connection pool of 64 to each of the nodes.and request controller, each HTTP GET request will fetch 100 keys from Redis cluster in batch mode.stress test 100 concurrency.just after running about 20 seconds and stop the stress test tool.it will already return an error and never recover.error log is.
'java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException' exception in org.redisson.jcache.JCacheEventCodec.I'm using a Redis Cluster over JCache API with Redisson 3.12.0.This is my codec:And I'm using javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener the following way:When the event occurs, it comes to org.redisson.jcache.JCacheEventCodec failing here:with this:Changing buf.readIntLE() / buf.readLongLE() to buf.readInt() / buf.readLong() fixes the issue.Can anyone assist with any explanations?
Redisson does not propogate security principal.see discourse here:So the bug comes down to the fact that Redisson uses StandardSession, which does not serialize the security credential at all. Redisson should either:Implement/Extend it's own Session object.Intentionally replicate security credentials.If a failover event occurs, it should go un-noticed to an end user.The user is logged out during a failover event.Steps to reproduce or test case.So you have two tomcat nodes: A & B, clustered in any fashion (forget I mentioned redisson) of your choosing; let's say they're clustered using the built in tcp point-to-point replication. Have 5 people logged into an application on the first server using standard JavaEE APIs (HttpServletrequest.login) Now turn off server A. Your load balancer starts sending traffic to server B. Their sessions will be there, BUT they will be logged out; one has to call HttpServletRequest.login() again. Upon login, Tomcat destroys the previous session (as it should), nullifying any benefit for clustering the application in the first place.
What happens when Locks are not released because of a thread terminate/crash.When using RLock to acquire Lock, Does LockWatchDog releases the lock when the thread that acquired the lock crashes for some reason without unlocking ?Does Redisson gurantee that taking a permit on semaphore via RPermitExpirableSemaphore/Semaphore is an atomic operation ? Means what happens when Redis or Redisson gets crashed in the process of creating the semaphore object ? Is there any chance that there is some partial state left on the Redis ?
onConnect, onDisconnect seem doesn't work as expected.We're using the Redis provided by AWS ElastiCache, Cluster mode and we need to handle some logic once losing connections with Redis, so we implement these 2 methods.I shutdown the Redis manually in order to test these methods. However, it doesn't work as expected.onDisconnect() is trigged successfully while onConnect() is also trigged unexpectly. Is there anything wrong inside?
Is it possible to destroy session on deserialization issue?Redisson version: 3.12.1.We have the next situation:Sometimes we update some of our entities that stored in a session.After that we get a lot of exceptions in log:We catch this exception when we trying to get some client session parameters.And it looks strange because the client already in the authorized zone and have a session, but actually session is invalid, so is it possible to invalidate session on deserialization?
JCacheEventCodec fails to read class name causing ClassNotFoundException.Hi! Thanks for your work! I'm pretty new to this client and now trying to understand how it should be configured.I'm using single node of Redis (5.0.7) with Redisson 3.12.1 and keep getting an error:Looking at the source code of JCacheEventCodec I noticed that it reads length of key differently depending on the platform. I'm running Java on Windows machine while Redis is on Linux. Now I want to figure out is it a bug or am I doing something in a wrong way?BTW I tried to rebuild Redisson with reading key length as long (as if it was Linux or Mac) and the error disappeared.
Listener question (about Lists)Hey, sorry for disburbing, is there a way or an event to listen to Object change (for example when I call RBucket.set(something) ?If no, what do you advise me to use instead ?Thanks in advance ! :)
Map EntryExpiredListener.Sentinel mode.Map EntryExpiredListener is disabled, which is restored after the application is restarted, but will be disabled again soon.I found that it would work every half hour during the failure, which should be a clue.
Memory leak or misconfigured.We are having an issue using Redisson with Hibernate 5.3.It appears the items are getting removed correctly due to the TTL, but their is still a Sorted Set that grows without ever getting pruned.Any of the " " grow without ever having elements removed.Current properties:Add sensible max. Otherwise they are unbounded.I've traced the code and I don't see any locations where the redisson__map_cache__last_access__set has any elements removed.In the MapCacheEvictionTask, it does pass in the key, but it is never used in the LUA.Let me know if I'm missing something in the config. Thanks!

Auto-Reconnect to a Modifed Elasticache Cluster.I am trying to optimize an elasticache cluster clustered mode disabled in productive use by downscaling to a smaller instance type. As we all know, AWS will migrate to new nodes with different IP addresses and the client will need to reconnect.  I would like to configure my redisson client to reconnect fast to the master node so we minimize the downtime as much as possible. What are the best practices to reduce downtime and to connect to new master nodes and slaves as fast as possible? Note that I am using ReplicatedServers to connect to the cluster.
Does any form of visibility / metrics / eventing require Redisson Pro.From what I can tell it does. I don't think this is justified. No one should be using a library - casually or otherwise - without metrics and a basic eventing system.There's many fine features of this product that I'd be HAPPY with as commercial only, including most of its task scheduling, but metrics is an absolute no-go.Of course my needs may be different from others, but I ask you to reconsider this. Even providing a basic eventing system that OSS could build metrics from would be great.

Can RRateLimiter create permits evenly.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.This doesn't seem to be a problem, I just don't think it is elegant enough.Describe the solution you'd like.When I use RRateLimiter:Like this, it will be 4 seconds apart and then create 8 permits in a split second.I think it is best if it can create 8 permits evenly in 4 seconds. Instead of creating 8 permits in an instant after 4 seconds. I hope it can be smart to create permits every 500ms.If I use "(RateType.OVERALL, 1, 500, RateIntervalUnit.MILLISECONDS)", this will affect the capacity of the bucket.Describe alternatives you've considered.I didn't think of a good solution, I just hope that he can create permits evenly according to my configuration.
RRateLimiter cannot update settings.I can provide a demo directly.Expected behavior.I hope I run the code after changing the rate in trySetRate() and the RRateLimiter can use the new rate.Actual behavior.In fact it will only use the rate set for the first time.I checked the KV in Redis and it hasn't changed.
RMapCache Cache expiration on a cluster of Redisson clients.Hi @mrniko ,I have a query regarding RMapCache expiration events . I have the following use case.I have a backend API which will push data to redis on an API call from a third party system . I am setting a ttl to the key because I want to initiate a process in the background when the key expires.The process to listen to key expiration events sits in a microservice.I read in the documentation there is a EntryExpiredListener for RMapCache.Now if the microservice sits in a cluster and if I am subscribing to key expiration events on RMapCache through EntryExpiredListener in each of my microservice instance then.a) if the key is "123" for example , on ttl expiry would all the instances get the key expiration notification ?b) if yes , is it possible to shard the key expiration events of RMapCache lets say in 100 expiration events , 50 events go to instance 1 and 50 got to instance 2 ?c) Whats the performance of key expiration listener if  I have 100000 expiration events to process , if there is only one instance ?  Is there a hard limit in terms of throttling the no of expired events per poll inside redis/redisson?Regards,Harish.
Inconsistent library versions reminder.Hi. I have implemented a tool to detect library version inconsistencies. Your project have 5 inconsistent libraries.Take org.awaitility:awaitility for example, this library is declared as version 3.1.0 in redisson-spring-data/redisson-spring-data-21, 3.1.6 in redisson and etc... Such version inconsistencies may cause unnecessary maintenance effort in the long run. For example, if two modules become inter-dependent, library version conflict may happen. It has already become a common issue and hinders development progress. Thus a version harmonization is necessary.Provided we applied a version harmonization, I calculated the cost it may have to harmonize to all upper versions including an up-to-date one. The cost refers to POM config changes and API invocation changes. Take org.awaitility:awaitility for example, if we harmonize all the library versions into 4.0.0. The concern is, how much should the project code adapt to the newer library version. We list an effort table to quantify the harmonization cost.The effort table is listed below. It shows the overall harmonization effort by modules. The columns represents the number of library APIs and API calls(NA,NAC), deleted APIs and API calls(NDA,NDAC) as well as modified API and API calls(NMA,NMAC). Modified APIs refers to those APIs whose call graph is not the same as previous version. Take the first row for example, if upgrading the library into version 4.0.0. Given that 13 APIs is used in module redisson, 13 of them is deleted in a recommended version(which will throw a NoMethodFoundError unless re-compiling the project),  0 of them is regarded as modified which could break the former API contract.Also we provided another table to show the potential files that may be affected due to library API change, which could help to spot the concerned API usage and rerun the test cases. The table is listed below.If you are interested, you can have a more complete and detailed report in the attached PDF file.redisson__fdse__redisson_2020-02-20.pdf.

Redisson entity invalidation with JCache CreatedExpiryPolicy.We are experimenting with Redisson through the JCache implementation. We don't understand completely the behaviour of Redisson using the JCache CreatedExpiryPolicy.Test.The test has been conducted using a cache with a TTL of 30 seconds and CreatedExpiryPolicy as expiry policy. An entry was created and put into the cache at the beginning of the tests, and checked using a loop. When the TTL expiration happens, we try to put again the entity in the cache.  To do this, we use another loop that performs retries until it succeeds.Actual behavior.When the entity is invalidated, it is not possible to put again a new entity with the same key for a given amount of time (usually some seconds). We also tried to remove the entity with that given key just after the invalidation, but it is not possible to do that. It seems like the entity is 'freezed' for a given amount of seconds. The duration of this 'freezed' status is not clear to us.In particular, during this 'freezed' status we noticed the following:on Redis the entity exists (we checked with redis-cli) with the new value and the same key;Redisson returns 'null' when we try to get the entity;the jcache_timeout_set:{cache-name} dataset on Redis (that we think is the one used by Redisson in order to keep track of the timestamps) keeps the old timestamp.Expected Behaviour.For our point of view, the entity should also be removed from Redis when the TTL is expired (probably at the very first moment in which one tries to get it from redis).Is the actual behaviour by design? How is the duration of this 'freezed' status established?

Overriding toString() method on a live object breaks the object.Hello,I discovered that overriding the toString() method on an object annotated with an @REntity results in the object not being stored in redis.Steps to reproduce:Then save the object through a RLiveObjectService.It appears that when I override the toString method but do it with:everything works fine, which leads me to believe that some method in the live object service is relaying on the toString method to id itself. If that is the case then this library should not be relying on the toString method, but should instead use that line above to get what it needs through reflection.

question with RBlockingQueue.poll(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS)Hi, in one of our environments BLPOP doesn't pop the elements, though there are elements in the queue when queried via redis-cli with LRANGE command. The issue happens only in one of the environments, are there any known issues with RBlockingQueue.poll(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS) where the timeout is zero? This method is called from a while(true) loop, the functionality works for 3-4 hours and then stops popping the elements. As I couldn't reproduce locally I couldn't attach the reproducible code.

java.io.IOException: Failed to read the next byte.Hi,I've run into the following exception and searching online does not yield any useful information. This is a Springboot app and the following is the config:We have multiple apps that are using tableOne and tableTwo, some writes some reads/writes. Each app has multiple instances.This exception happens after the initialization of tableTwo. TableOne has always been fine. We are able to circumvent this by doing tableTwo().clear() during startup but the following error returns when it is being used. Has anyone run into this issue before or have any guess/insight of what's going on?
Redisson Configuration For AWS ElastiCache.Hi, we are using redisson with elasticache (Cluster Mode Disabled). We have 3 nodes.

RExecutorService - Some tasks won't get executed.The setup:Service A -> Producing tasks to executor service.Service B -> Consuming tasks (RedissonNode)ServiceA static, ServiceB is autoscaled in N replicas.Expected behaviour.All tasks put into executor service will get executed, tasks counter is reporting correct value.Actual behaviour.Some tasks won't get executed, the task counter is reporting negative numbers.Steps to reproduce or test case.I was trying hard to get a reproducer on this but I am unable to simulate it deterministically. But I tracked it down to shutdown of the redisson node.The best that could be done for reproducing the issue is to run n replicas of RedissonNode(s) schedule hundreds of tasks to the executor service and then shut down and startup some of these RedissonNodes. If for example the task print some random id or stores it somewhere you will find out that some ids are missing even though the queue is empty (the tasks HASH is empty) and counter is having a negative value of exact number of missing tasks.My hypothesis is that the issue is in org.redisson.executor.TasksRunnerService#executeCallable.if the RedissonInstance is in shutdown state the finally clause will still decrement the counter but as the exception is not thrown the task is not re-queued. But it is a wild guess.
decodeInExecutor=true isn’t compatible with certain replays.Expected behavior.Configuring decodeInExecutor=true works for all replays.Actual behavior.We receive periodic IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions during decoding, because of Netty’s implementation of ReplayingDecoderByteBuf#copy.Steps to reproduce or test case.We are using  RedissonSessionRepository (Spring Session), and can reproduce by running two application instances. We use ab to creating many sessions on one of them. The other instance receives many messages—created, expired, etc.I don’t have a code test case, but the issue is readily apparent in the debugger. When the ByteBuf is copied for the executor, the copy is of the underlying buffer—the special behavior of ReplayingDecoderByteBuf is lost. This means that incomplete messages cause IndexOutOfBounds exceptions, rather than having the message rewound and decoding retried once there is more data in the buffer.I’m not sure if this should be considered a bug in Netty, but I’ve filed netty/netty#10122.

Is it possible to restrict session loading/saving to specific requests?I'm working on a legacy project and trying to integrate Redisson Tomcat. The project uses the session object to store lots of data, and doesn't use setAttribute to do it. Because of this I'm forced to use the AFTER_REQUEST update mode. Since every page needs multiple calls to the server to render the whole process is very slow as Redisson will load and then save the session on every request.Is it possible to restrict session loading/saving to specific requests? I couldn't see a mechanism which enables it so I thought of injecting a valve before the UpdateValve which will skip it in specific cases. Is there a better way?

Spring Data connector sends multiGet (MGET) commands to master instead of slave.Expected behavior.When using a master/slave configuration using Sentinel and ReadMode of SLAVE, all Redis reads should go to the slave nodes.Actual behavior.Reads of type multiGet (MGET) get sent to the master node.Steps to reproduce or test case.NOTE: To reproduce, use the Spring Data Redisson connector.Set up a master/slave Redis configuration using Sentinel and run the Redis MONITOR command on master and slave nodes.Do a SET on a key. You should see the command on the master node first. The master will send the command to its slaves.Do a GET on the key. You should see the command on the slave node.Do an MGET on an array of keys including the key you just set.

FstCodec copy constructor doesn’t preserve ConfType of FSTConfiguration.We have the following code:When a copy of the codec is created by RedisExecutor, the ConfType of the FstConfiguration is always DEFAULT.This can be fixed by using FSTConfiguration#deriveConfiguration.
FstCodec exception when copying session map in changeSessionId.We’re currently switching from Lettuce to Redisson to handle our Spring Sessions. We’re using FstCodec, because JacksonJsonCodec doesn’t support all of the objects we need to serialize.We’re getting an exception processing the response from Redis when reading the old map (stack trace at end).It looks like the issue is that the map’s codec isn’t being passed to the batch command, so FstCodec is being used for both keys and values, rather than the map’s CompositeCodec(StringCodec, FstCodec).
Redisson error when create client.Hello, when I create a client I have an error with netty...The code:I use the last version of redisson.
Redisson considers XREADGROUP and XCLAIM commands as read only but redis considers them read-write commands not allowing these commands to be executed on read-only replica.Expected behavior.In a sentinel environment with 1 master(write only), 2 slaves (Read only), Redisson Stream's readGroup and Claim method should execute commands on redis master node.Actual behavior.The XREADGROUP and XCLAIM redis commands are actually write commands in redis but Redisson consider these as read only commands and executes on slave nodes resulting in the following error.from redis:Steps to reproduce or test case.Use readGroups and claim  method in a  master-slave redis environment with master being write only and slaves being read only.
DB count not decreased as expected.Does mybatis-redisson keep on sending query to DB in background? I changed in project from local mybatis cache in distributed env. to redis cache using mybatis but load on DB is still same. I expected load on DB lesser after using redisson-mybatis.
about reading from replicas.Configuring only few maps for strong consistency:Can i configure that few maps are read from the replicas and for others where i need strong consistency are read from the master only?In this way i get strong consistency and also performance for other maps.If not, can i have  to have two redisson instances with different configurations (one with read from replicas and other w/o )  for doing this?Preventing data loss for map.have a copy of map and write to it every time when the primary map changes name the map in such way that slot# is on different redis master when there is a node crash, start using other map as primary map (we are planning to use elastic cache ,hopefully there is a way to get notified which master failed)
use redisson make jvm old generation overflow.Expected behavior.redisson use without problem.Actual behavior.Steps to reproduce or test case.
Improve RLock reliability during failover and deprecate RedLock.The main idea behind RedLock algorithm is to overcome losing of lock acquisition during failover since Redis replication is asynchronous. Moreover its effectiveness still subject of dispute.To overcome this every Redis command execution made by RLock object is synchronized through WAIT command introduced in Redis 3.0.

Sentinelconnectionmanageris not correctly in IPv6 dual stack environments.Note:this ticket is different from ticket2471 and ticket2303.I found the following bugs in the SentinelConnectionManager class,my test environment is as follows,three sentinels(node10, node14, noe15),one master(node14), one slave(node15), the network environment of each node is IPv6 dual stack, and the IP of each node is as follows:The application program runs in node14 and node15 respectively. The following logs are captured in node14 and printed frequently in the log:When the application is initialized, we will get all sentinels in the constructor of SentinelConnectionManager by synchronously call (140 lines):connection.sync(StringCodec.INSTANCE, RedisCommands.SENTINEL_SENTINELS, cfg.getMasterName()),debug log as below:In the function scheduleChangeCheck, we will asynchronously call(446 lines), RedisCommands.SENTINEL_SENTINELS, cfg.getMasterName()). Get the sentinel of the current time point, and the debug print is as follows:
The idle connection does not be released after redis cluster failover.In cluster mode, when I called cluster failover in redis-cli, the redis-cli client list showed that connection number increased than masterConnectionMinimumIdleSize/ slaveConnectionMinimumIdleSize  while those connections idle time is larger than idleConnectionTimeout. I have tried both redisson verion 3.7.2 and 3.12.4, redis verion 3.2.9 and 5.0.8. So i wander why the idle connection does not be released after redis cluster failover? It's a feature or the problem of setting or just a bug? Thanks for reply.Here is my setting of redisson:Here is my redisson connection count and details, and you can see there are many connection idle time is larger than 10s, cmd is NULL, and connection number is larger than masterConnectionMinimumIdleSize, but is does not release the idle connection.

How does Redisson handle concurrent requests?Say I have a page which requires two requests to render. In my session I hold a variable A=1. I use Redisson with readMode="MEMORY" updateMode="AFTER_REQUEST" broadcastSessionEvents="false".Now I load the page. Both requests fire concurrently, the first completes before the second. The first request goes to Redis, gets A=1, changes it to A=2 and persists the session to Redis. The second request goes to Redis, gets A=1, does nothing and persists the session to Redis. Now in Redis I have A=1, even though I expected A=2.Does Redisson do anything clever to handle this scenario or is it up to me?
RLiveObjectService  search conditions not working as expected.LiveobjectService find method not working as expected, I am trying to search an object based on its  properties values, something like this.It should not return any values is condition is not satisfied.Actual behavior.It's returning all the values.Steps to reproduce or test case.Create an object with at least 3 properties, Populate it with random values and store it as live objects.Use something line below-mentioned code to replicate.Here if.Lets say we have following entries.
RTopic.countListeners() unexpected result.Consider the following code:The countListeners should return 1 per topic.It looks like the countListeners returns the total of listeners registred for all topics (2 in this case).
RedisNodeNotFoundException after failover in AWS Elasticache.Expected behavior : Redisson should be able to talk to redis without any hiccups while failover is in progress or completed.Actual behavior  : After failover is completed, redisson is throwing exceptions for a slot which is 1684. It also mentions that it is unable to connect to master in logs.Why we think redisson is causing issue and not redis:When the application was restarted which means the redisson was disconnected and reconnected to same configuration URL. Redisson worked fine, which tell us the issue was with redisson and not redis. We could see that all slots were covered via redis console and also via redis-cli. We were able to connect and retrieve data from 1684 slot from redis-cli. Cluster nodes and Cluster info command also shows everything is fine.Below is the logs of interest:Steps to reproduce or test case:While the application was running. We have triggered a manual failover from AWS elasticache console. Which resulted in this exception. It is consistently reproducible.Redis version: Elasticache Redis 5.0.6, cluster mode, ssl enabled, password enabled. Redisson connects using configuration URL provided for redis.

RedissonReactiveSubscription is not initialized properly and as a result - no messages are handled.Expected behavior.In case of using through org.springframework.data.redis.core.ReactiveStringRedisTemplate, I expect to handle messages from the channel I subscribed to via reactiveRedisTemplate.listenTo(channel)Actual behavior.The subscription via reactiveRedisTemplate.listenTo(channel) is happening and redis-cli PUBLISH channel hello returns (integer) 1, but NO messages are handled.Spent some time debugging, I noticed that anonymous subclass of BaseRedisPubSubListener  is created in RedissonReactiveSubscription.receive() with overridden onMessage(CharSequence channel, Object msg) method which as I understand should handle all the messages from redis channel (by the way, perhaps you could explain why BaseRedisPubSubListener overrides onMessage with empty implementation? ).In fact the listener handles all messages and swallows it somewhere, debugging the message hits onMessage breakpoint, but nothing happened then.By the way, in some unexplainable cases (I really don't know how to explain it) somewhere in the code the SubscribeListener is initialized and message that is handled by that listener is handled downstream (happens only in debug mode with some combination of breakpoints placed:)).But event in that base, a single message first handled by BaseRedisPubSubListener empty implementation of onMessage and only then by SubscribeListener which translates the message downstream.I tried a lot of times but didn't understand what is really needed to achieve this.Steps to reproduce or test case.Initialize ReactiveStringRedisTemplate with regular spring config (example attached).Call reactiveRedisTemplate.listenTo(channel) and subscribe to it.

Best method to zero-out Bloomfilter.I'm wondering what the best approach would be using Redisson to zero-out (remove all entries) residing in the bloomfilter entry generated by Redisson's RedissonBloomFilter.tryInit() and .add commands?
none.
RedissonSession retains reference to wrong map after changeSessionId.When RedissonSession#changeSessionId is called, state is copied to the new key in Redis, but the field remains a reference to the old RMap. Any subsequent session updates in that request will get persisted to the wrong key.
Spring session timeout.The spring session documentation has two spring boot ways of configuring session timeout (spring.session.timeout, server.servlet.session.timeout) Redisson does not make use of either of these, instead you have to set it on the EnableRedissonHttpSession annotation which is not configurable.
SessionExpiredEvent and SessionDestroyedEvent.Inside RedissonSessionRepository is code for publishing session expired, session destroyed, and session created events. Of these, i have only been able to get the session created event to fire. What circumstances trigger the destroyed and expired events?Have attempted deleting by session id from the repository, deleting directly in redis, and trying to load an expired session from the repository, waiting for the entry to expire on its own. Thank you.

Simplifying debugging of sentinel connection problems.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.Yes; it's a problem. It's difficult to debug connection problems when connecting to sentinel servers fails. Example log below. When each sentinel node connection fails, a small warning with no stack trace and real error message is emitted. When finally no connection is made a message with list of servers tried is included. We've no information about the actual underlying problem.Describe the solution you'd like.Collect the exceptions in a list and output them with stack traces after it's established that no connection was made.Describe alternatives you've considered.Log stack dumps to INFO or DEBUG.
I don't want redisson connect to some specific nodes in redis cluster, can I do it?If yes, how?I have a redis cluster with 3 master and 6 slave,and I want redisson only connect to the nodes in config file.
ReactiveValueOperations#set result calls onComplete directly without offering Boolean value.The Mono<Boolean> set(K key, V value, Duration timeout) in ReactiveValueOperations  from Spring Data Redis Reactive implies the Mono will return an Boolean to indicate success or fail.However when using Redisson's Spring Data Redis Integration, the response is either onComplete or onError. It's not revealed in documents that this method should not rely on the Boolean value. It would be easier to use the integration if documents offers these important information.Besides, the Spring Boot Starter includes spring-boot-starter-web module which conflicts with newer spring-boots-starter-webflux module, which is necessary for Spring Webflux applications.After exclude the spring-boot-starter-web module from Gradle, Redisson Starter works well. So, can the web module be removed from starter dependencies officially, or, change it to other dependencies?
wheather use the shared instance or a new one, when getting reids object every time?hi,@mrniko.in the following scenarios, i do not know how to use the API, can you give me some advice?since the password of the server will be changed, the client needs to get a new redisson object every time to access redis server. then, how to configure the codec?1、redissonClient.getBucket("a", new JsonJacksonCodec()).set(new Animal());Whether the above code will cause OOM when used in multiple threads,described in #2574.2、redissonClient.getBucket("a", JsonJacksonCodec.INSTANCE).set(new Animal());if so, is there performance issue with json serialization and deserialization?Gilberto Torrezan said "the ObjectMapper is indeed Thread safe. But reusing the same object can decrease the performance of your application, since all - 1 threads can be locked at a given time waiting for the owner of the lock to complete the serialization/deserialization of JSON." in.and, wheather you provide this  instance(JsonJacksonCodec.INSTANCE) to advise not to new  instance every time?thanks!

Redisson fastRemove not working in AWS Lambda.Hi,We use redisson library pom dependency for an AWS lambda code. The lambda job is to evict a cache entry from the AWS Redis cache. The Lambda has stopped working since we have upgraded the redisson version from 3.3.1 to 3.12.3. Looking at the Lambda cloudwatch logs, we can see the following in logs.But the entry in the cache is not deleted. There is no exception/error in the logs. Is there any known issue related to it or are we missing any configuration in the latest version to make the deletes happen.We use the following code.
MapLoader and TTL.Is it possible to load entry into hash map (e.g. RMapCache) and set TTL for loaded entry? What would be workaround if this feature not exists?I would like to add entries into cache using read-through strategy but to keep that entries with TTL and evicted after TTL.Thanks,Marko.

Master fail over with AWS ElastiCache with ReplicatedServersConfig.We have 1 primary and 2 replicas in our production AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster (cluster mode disabled). All three nodes given to ReplicatedServersConfig as mentioned in. We have set scan interval as 2000, and readMode as MASTER. We are using replicas only for failover, when we tested failover to one of the slaves, the Redisson client still sending the write requests to replica (which is old master) and failing with error org.redisson.client.RedisException: READONLY You can't write against a read only replica.Does it have to anything to do with readMode? Should we use SLAVE or MASTER_SLAVE?With readMode MASTER redissonClient.getRedisNodes(RedisNodes.MASTER_SLAVE).getSlaves().size() returns 0, so I assume it will not have old slaves info in the context.

JbossMarshallingRiver Codec implementation corrupts objects serialized in the thread which had a serialization exception before.Expected behavior.For JbossMarshallingRiver Codec.If I encounter notSerializableException for an object, then any other object afterwards sent for serialization should not be incorrectly serialized i.e there should not be any cascading effects.Actual behavior.On encountering notSerializableException , some objects serialized  in the same thread afterwards throw unsupported protocol version exception during deserialization.Root Cause.When an encoding exception (like notSerializable) occurs during encoding, Marshaller methods finish() and close() are not called and since the Marhsaller encoder is stored in FastThreadLocal variable,further serialization by same marshaller create a problem. We have fixed same by simply applying try{..} finally clause in our implementation and it works.Mostly default configuration but with MarshallingCodec.
Question about retryAttempts&retryInterval.In our environment, we see randomly long time access due to some commands go to 1 time or 2 times retry.  ~1500ms(retryInterval) passed after connection acquired but not able to send command and go to attempt.Restart Redis server will recover it.I wonder to know:In which possible scenarios Redis command can't be sent to Redis server, and enter retry mode?Why restart Redis server can recover?
Connection Pool refresh. Redis ips keep changing.Hi, we have deployed our Redis on Kubernetes and the pods can die. One of our java apps uses redisson. I want to know if there is any setting that if one of my pod dies and a new pod comes up with new IP redisson can get the new IP and refresh the connection pool?
In a sentinel configuration, the configuration subscriptionMode.SLAVE does not seem to work.Hi,My question is regarding configuration.for redisson pubsub in a redis sentinel environment.Since redis master node does not seem to replicate topics and subscription to the slaves. I wanted to know how does redisson track on which slave nodes topics have been created. Also,  if a subscription is created on slave node, it will not replicate to anywhere (being a slave) for two logical reasons:Redis does not replicate topic subscriptions to slaves.A slave does not replicate anything to other nodes in Sentinel.I am asking this question, because I am unable to publish messages with this configuration.I will be happy to be corrected if my assumptions above are wrong.
Get multiple delayed queues of one queue.Hi all,I wanna create two delayed queues, whose items can be both transferred to one specific queue.

Redisson cannot reconnect to Redis cluster after Redis service is bounced.Hello, I'm current experiencing an issue with a Redis cluster(5.0.7) on Redisson 3.12.0 while testing how our system will handle the outage.I'm using the springboot+Redisson. The test case will keep writing data to Redis Cluster.  On system startup, everything looks good and cache keys created in all the shards. However, if I take down the entire cluster and restart it again, I saw a bunch of following exception:Per the output of "CLUSTER NODES", all the nodes' status is "connected".Expected behavior.Redisson successfully reconnects to the cluster after the cluster restarts.Actual behavior.Throw exception every time the slot is in 2nd/3rd shard, which means slot number is larger than 5460.Steps to reproduce or test case.
How does redisson determine the number of connections to Redis.I use https as my redis-cluster which crates 3 masters ans 3 slaves. I use the following redisson configurations:On app start up, I use "CLIENT LIST | grep MyService | wc -l" to calculate all the connection numbers on each node and get the following results:Could u please help to clarify how Redisson determine the connection numbers? or do we have any document that can describe the internal mechanism?
On sentinel failover, connections to the new master are getting doubled.version: 3.12.4.When force failing over the number of connections to the new master are getting doubled. We establish around 6000 connections to redis server across all application servers. We didn't change the default idle connections from 24. After failover we observe 48 idle connection to new master, and it's not coming down till we restart the application servers. Because of this issue we had to change the max connections in redis-server to 20000 from 10000.
Idle connection is not killed after timeout.I use the above settings. The connections is always 2 event the idle time is bigger than 20 seconds.Did I miss something?Btw, for the connections in master node, it always 4 and no connection is closed after idleConnectionTimeout.

DNS monitoring for cluster mode.We have a prod env which is using Redis cluster in AWS and aws provide a cluster endpoint. Our redisson configuration is cluster mode. But we just use the cluster endpoint in nodeAddress but not a list of cluster nodes:When we upgrade Redis cluster,  ip address of all the nodes are  changed. It seems that Redisson cannot figure out the new ip address. It keeps  reconnecting to the old ip addresses and we have to bounce all the micro services to mitigate this issue.I found that DNS monitoring is not enabled for cluster mode. Do you have any suggestion do solve/work-around this issue?

How to stop Redisson connecting to a stale node.We have a Redis cluster in AWS, in which there're 50 master nodes. Each master node has 1 slave node.One of the nodes looks like.I use nslookup to check the ip address of these dns records.master(001-001.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com) has ip : 172.31.33.149.slave(001-002.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com) has ip : 172.31.33.51.Our Redisson client keeps connecting to an unknown ip:  172.31.33.151.Per the result of "cluster nodes", I found that the unknown ip is a failed slave node,Per the AWS console, I'm sure that dns name of the current slave is 172.31.33.51.So the ip 151 should be stale and we should not reconnect to that address. The retry attempts throw a timeout exception and make cpu/memory usage high, which lead to memory leak issue.Our system do have connection for the master node (ip 172.31.33.149) and the new slave node (ip 172.31.33.51)Is there any way/configuration to stop Redisson connecting to the stale node?

RedissonTransactionalMapCache.put() creates entries with incorrect TTLs.When calling RedissonTransactionalMapCache.put(K key, V value, long ttl, TimeUnit ttlUnit, long maxIdleTime, TimeUnit maxIdleUnit), the TTL for cache entries is not set correctly.  The problem is that putAsync is passing the expiration timestamp into putOperationAsync.  However, the code in expect it to be a passed the actual TTL value.What happens is that when we get here (in BaseTransactionalMapCache)The ttlTimeout is a timestamp (number of ms since the epoch) rather than the timeout.  This results in the entries being created with what is effectively an infinite TTL.Expected behavior.Entries are created with the provided TTL.Actual behavior.Entries are created with a TTL of ~50 years.Steps to reproduce or test case.If you check the TTL, using map.remainTimeToLive(key), you will see that it is well over 600.  The value you get back is approximately System.
Do async operations come with ordering guarantees?Is the order in which async operations are submitted to the Redisson client guaranteed to match the order in which they are actually executed?For context, I am using RStream.addAllAsync to submit items to a stream, and I need the items stream order to exactly match the addAllAsync call order. Are there any race conditions possible with rapid calls to this method (1-2ms delays between calls) that would result in out-of-order insertion?Thanks in advance!

RateLimiter Overall configuration across different nodes.Hi,I have 3 different processes accessing Redis. I am using the below code to make sure only one node gets hold of the resource for the specified time.My understanding here is 1 permit is available for every 60 seconds. If one node is processing the code after acquiring the permit, other nodes trying to call acquire should get as false.Here, other nodes are able to acquire the lock without 60 seconds delay. Is there something wrong with the usage? Please help me understand how would I hold the access on the resource for the specified time.

RScoredSortedSet.entryRange() can't get entry list under redis cluster?Redisson version:3.7.5.I created a redis cluster of three masters and three slaves in the virtual machine.I want to test whether the scoresortedset supports clustering.So I wrote a unit test class.I found that the key and score can be inserted normally in the scoreportedset, but when I try to read the size of the current scoreportedset, I find that the return value is 0.This is the output:I tried distributed lock under this condition. It seems that there is no problem, so I am confused about the above problems.I hope you can answer my question, thank you.

Connectivity issue while using Redis.We have a Redis cluster(running in Sentinel mode) with 3 nodes and we are using Redisson (version 3.10.7) to interact with Redis.Since last one week, we are facing an issue in our Development environment wherein the client application is not able to connect to the cluster. Continuously older connections are being dropped and new connections are being created. Below is the snapshot for the logger.We tried below points to investigate the issue:Restart the client application.Restart Redis cluster nodes.Post these restarts as well, the same issue persisted. We were able to resolve the issue by changing the "timeout" property from 0 to 10 seconds in server.conf of Redis. On reverting timeout back to 0 also is not causing the issue again.
Connection leak issue while using Redis-Redisson.We have a Redis cluster(running in Sentinel mode) with 3 nodes and we are using Redisson (version 3.10.7) to interact with Redis. While checking for some other issue, we noticed a high number of client being connected to server.On further investigation, we noticed the below scenarios.In case app restart is not done as well, connection remains open even though we have a "timeout" set at server level. Is Redisson leaving the older connection open  and creates a new one in case of redis server crash or network glitch?Also, I noticed that with each client connection to Redis server,Redis is opening 4 file descriptor. Is this normal?

Why we need to execute SENTINEL SENTINELS command?In this case, I configured the all intranet domain sentinel node list info.like this.But I can't start redisson successfully,  it throws a RedisConnectionException with 'SENTINEL SENTINELS command returns less than 2 nodes..' message.Because the first configured sentinel node will be used to execute the SENTINEL SENTINELS MASTER_NAME command when initializing the SentinelConnectionManager, and then try to connect to the returned node list.But the IP:PORT information of the sentinel node list we return is inaccessible by the current machine(By default, we only allow access via intranet domain), So all these sentinel node failed to register, except the current node(It uses intranet domain access).Can we add an option to directly use the configured node list without having to execute the  SENTINEL SENTINELS MASTER_NAME command to get the list?Now, I called dba to restart the sentinel node list, and replaced the sentinel list information, so that the information returned by sentinel list api can be accessed by my current machine, temporarily solved this problem.However, if my new machine in another network cluster also needs to use redisson to connect to this sentinel cluster, things will become more troublesome.
Redisson scalable put on cluster nodes.Hello:I am new to Redis. And I wrote a simple code to test hashmap objects in a Redis cluster of 3 nodes.Then I try the redis-cli to get all hashmap objects. it seems that all pairs are stored on the same cluster node instead of round-robin.However, when I use the redis-cli to put key and value pairs into the cluster, I can see it is round-robin.May I know how to put hashmap object in the round-robin way?In my test environment, redission maven.redis server 6.0.1.Thanks.

Auto configuration for reactive redis client in Spring Boot.Currently I am using Redisson for locks with the RedissonClient that gets automatically configured via the spring.redis.(host|port|password) properties in the application.yaml which is super convenient.Now I wanted to include some message handling via reactive topics to return a Flux for a websocket-based subscription. Thus I attempted to autowire a RedissonReactiveClient and noticed it isn't autoconfigured.I am curious what the proposed way to expose a RedissonReactiveClient bean with the same configuration would look like.

AWS Reader DNS being defined as master during failover.Scenario:We configured Redisson with 2 AWS DNS endpoints: Primary and Reader. Primary has one node and Reader has 2.After failover, one of the read replicas got promoted as the primary. Technically, since this happened behind the scene in AWS, we should not see any change to the Primary and Reader.However, in Redisson log, we saw the type of the Reader endpoint got changed to be Master.Before failover:Wonder if this is a bug or we didn't configure our Redisson correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Support for SETXX operation.I have a use case in which I must update a value only if the key exists. This is supported by the SET XX option.I was wondering if it makes sense to enhance the RedissonBucket class to support a setIfPresent operation(s) - encapsulating the SET XX command just like trySet does for SET NX, or if I should just try to get an instance of CommandAsyncService and run the command myself.I'm happy to contribute to this feature if it's deemed useful.

SyncStrategy.INVALIDATE publish without subscribe possible?Hi!We have a redis server with about 600 commands per seconds sent via redisson. And we have some cronjobs that update information in the db (and cache). We are using redisson 3.12.3 with LocalCachedMap with the following options.The synchronization is working great. However, since the cronjob is setting up new connections then disconnects we often during the peak hours receive errors like so.I'm thinking that we can either wait longer for the shutdown or configure the instance not to subscribe to updates? I realize that this might be a weird use case, I tried manually constructing the publish command but got lost somewhere in the command encoding. I'm thinking that ideally a new SyncStrategy that only publish invalidation, and doesn't listen to them, would be the best solution for us.
[Cluster] scanning nodes stops if `ClusterConnectionManager#addMasterEntry` fails.Expected behavior.Periodic scan of cluster nodes runs forever (every scanInterval milliseconds)Actual behavior.Periodic scan of cluster nodes stops when a single master is added to the cluster and Redisson cannot perform CLUSTER INFO.Steps to reproduce or test case.Failure to perform CLUSTER INFO is probably a side effect from another problem but I expect that Redisson can recover.I'm using a 6 nodes cluster in a VM (libvirt) environment on 3 virtual machines. Each VM hosts one master and one slave in way that master and slave happens to be on different VMs (master1 is on VM1, but slave1 is on VM2; master2 is on VM2, while slave2 is on VM3 and master3 is on VM3 while slave3 is on VM1). Hard stop VM2 which effectively disconnects master2 and slave1. Then I bring back VM2. Former master2 is no longer master so I promote it to be master again by executing CLUSTER FAILOVER on it. After I do so, Redisson attempts to reconnect to master2 but for unknown reason fails with:All defaults, except useClusterServer and one node address.Notes.I traced back the issue to org.redisson.cluster.ClusterConnectionManager#checkMasterNodesChange: addMasterEntry returns failed future (e is not null) and  futures.addAll(res); is never executed. As a result result future is never resolved and the next round of scanning is not performed.
RedissonCacheStatisticsAutoConfiguration conditions not matched.Expected behavior.I expect to get metrics of RedissonSpringCacheManager.Actual behavior.But RedissonCacheStatisticsAutoConfiguration not matched to condition @ConditionalOnBean({CacheManager.class, RedissonCache.class})The reason is that there isn't RedissonCache bean registered in context.If you dive deep into RedissonSpringCacheManager you can see RedissonCache instance created, but not registered in ApplicationContext and it should not.RedissonCacheStatisticsAutoConfiguration":{"notMatched":[{"condition":"OnBeanCondition","message":"@ConditionalOnBean (types: org.springframework.cache.CacheManager,org.redisson.spring.cache.RedissonCache; SearchStrategy: all) did not find any beans of type org.redisson.spring.cache.RedissonCache"}].Steps to reproduce or test case.Fail case:Configure spring boot cache (see below)Configure spring-boot-starter-data-redis (ip, port, db)Use spring cache annotations on objects an methods.check /actuator/metrics.You won't see any cache metrics.Success case:Repeat all from Fail case (steps 1-3)Register RedissonCacheMeterBinderProvider on your own.check /actuator/metrics.You will see cache.puts, cache.gets, cache.size metrics.

volumes for redis replica nodes in docker swaram environment?We have an application in which we are using Redis as a small database.We are using Redis in a master-slave configuration in docker swarm environment. We have 1 master node and 2 replica nodes.For persistent storage we have enabled volumes for master/replica nodes in docker swarm environment e.g if container restarts it can pick data from the volumes file on disk.Few of my doubts are as below -.Is it necessary to enable volumes for replica nodes?If we have volumes enabled for replica nodes, in a scenario when replica docker container restarts, will it pick its data from its volumes file on disk? or it ignores that file and only get data after syncing with master node?Please let me know if you need more information.
org.redisson.client.RedisException occurs after upgrading redisson client.After upgrading redisson client from 2.2.12 to 3.10.6 there are a lot of org.redisson.client.RedisException errors when performing various queries to Redis via redisson.It seems there are a couple of issues:There cannot be two applications using different redisson versions at the same time, e.g. App1 with 2.2.12 and App2 with 3.10.6, otherwise the RedisException occurs.The keys created by the old version must be flushed, otherwise the RedisException occurs.Expected behavior.After upgrading redisson client from 2.2.12 to 3.10.6 new keys can be created and old keys can be read/updated without errors.Actual behavior.After upgrading redisson client from 2.2.12 to 3.10.6 new keys cannot be created and old keys cannot be read/updated without RedisException.Question.Is there a way to avoid flushing the cache in order to avoid the errors?
redisson lock.Hello,I have a quick question about the redisson lock.Does the redisson lock is share between all clients ?

support of aws unique reader endpoint for Redis.Hello,Should I use useMasterSlaveServers for an AWS redis (1 master - 2 slaves) with an unique reader endpoint (Amazon ElastiCache launches reader endpoints for Redis)here is my current configuration.Remember we haven't enabled the cluster mode .. We have only 1 master with 2 slaves.However we got 2 troubles (redis-2 is the primary, redis-1 and redis-3 are the slaves)As you can see in the picture, the current connections between the 2 slaves are strange. I know there is load balacing between the 2 slaves. But why the connections fall back to 0 periodically ? Should I increase the maximum idle time of the connections before they are released ?Then after the failover, 2 services failed to reconnect on the master node. Our other services had no problems with  the same configuration.It makes no sense to me because the unique primary endpoint and the unique reader endpoint have not changed ... Should I disabled the dns monitoring interval on the redis client ?let me know if you have answers to these troubles.Thanks.

Unable to acquire connection when all connections are free and nothing is in queue..@mrniko on occasion we are seeing timeouts like this..from what I gather all connections are free, none are in queue yet it still didn't manage to acquire a connection.. does this indicate all Netty threads are busy decoding a response, in which case we should consider adopting the dedicated executor for decoding, or something else?

Is it possible to access to the data maintained or written by Redisson in Nodejs? And would it be a bad practice?Hi, I have using Redisson for not a long time, and I realize that I need my old project to access to Redis and retrieve data that is maintained by the current Java code which use Redisson.But Redisson is not just a redis client but a In-Memory Data Grid, therefore it's quite different and not compatible friendly for nodejs program for it only has pure redis client tools to use.So the idea I have is:Write a Java Redisson program as a proxy and serve data for nodejs program.Figure out how Redisson save data, for sorted set, and Bucket, and write a package for nodejs to decode data from Redis.Give up Redisson and use pure redis client, like Redis.Is there any other solutions? Or is there any nodejs middleware for Redisson? Would that be difficult to write one for Redisson(I haven't read much source code of Redisson yet)?Thanks.

Logging: CommandAsyncService.get(RFuture<V> future) and InterruptedException.We notice with small connection pool sizes under load that some promises seem to be interrupted or time out. This is normal behavior, but the root cause is omitted under the stack trace.Redisson tries future.await(), catching the InterruptedException. In this case I believe future.isSuccess() is unlikely to return true, and convertException will be called. If InterruptedException is the cause for the future failing, we want to preserve that as part of the cause in the stack trace.

Replace slf4j-simple Dependency w/ slf4j-api.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.Redisson in https creates a hard dependency on an SLF4J binding, which if you already have a binding in place in your application, causes logs like:Note the link and warning from SLF4J: http.  This is a random behavior and could be catastrophic depending on your intended logging config versus what Redisson attempts to do. Also note this paragraph:Embedded components such as libraries or frameworks should not declare a dependency on any SLF4J binding but only depend on slf4j-api. When a library declares a compile-time dependency on a SLF4J binding, it imposes that binding on the end-user, thus negating SLF4J's purpose. When you come across an embedded component declaring a compile-time dependency on any SLF4J binding, please take the time to contact the authors of said component/library and kindly ask them to mend their ways.Describe the solution you'd like.Remove the dependency on slf4j-simple and replace it with slf4j-api like is recommended by SLF4J.  This is noted in the SLF4J link above and is concisely:Embedded components such as libraries or frameworks should not declare a dependency on any SLF4J binding but only depend on slf4j-api.Describe alternatives you've considered.We have considered rebuilding the Redisson jars to remove this dependency, but it should not be there to begin with.

Redis native commands are not supported using redisson client.I wanted to run Redis Native commands using redisson provided low-level client, However.  Some of the commands i see not exposed from.I just explored String and Hash commands, however list of commands not supported might be more.Usage:a) Is there are way i can actually run the redis native commands via some interfaces?b) Any reason why redisson is not exposing complete set of redis native commands? Does Redisson make any effort on a regular basis to support new commands that are offered by Redis?
Better support for subclassing RedissonRegionFactory.Hi, to configure redisson for hibernate only using code (like env variables) i subclass the RedissonRegionFactory and override method createRedissonClient. This works great until i want to take advantage of the property hibernate.cache.redisson.fallback. This property has private access so i cant alter it in the same way as the base class do. My only way forward is via reflections which is hackish...Could you provide a protected setter or refactor code for fallback-setting to a protected method? Also allow for inheritance in the future. Thanks!

hibernate 2LC, multiple tomcat node is causing flush on each node join to cluster.hi everybody,I am experiencing unexpected behaviour(at least from my perspective) when I try to use RedissonRegionFactory.what I am trying to do is:I have a clustered application and all of my nodes are using same database, and I was configured ehcache for second level cache on each node, and when something happened on one entity, I was sending an event to other nodes for evict their 2LC to keep data consitenct over the cluster.  Now I try to replace that eh_cache + event system with one central 2lc provider.for that surpose,  first node is connecting and configuring redis on its startup.how I am configuring redis: after first node startup is completed I put a flag on redis to avoid second configuration from other nodes.I am able to see redis keys/values like this:I would be appreciated for any idea advice whatever to help to understand why this behave like this.

Set Redisson config using AWS ElastiCache as Clustered Mode.Hey there!What is the proper way to configure Redisson when you have a AWS ElastiCache Redis running as Clustered Mode? I have tried to set using it as follows:Configuration endpoint: test-rest-encryption.p0vefj.clustercfg.use1.cache.amazonaws.com.For nodeAddress, I have tried to use configuration endpoint and node endpoint but fails in both case (connection timed out): Am I missing something?
sentinel more failure ,You can't write against a read only replica..use redisson sentinel mode.
instead of creating config out of redisson file, get config object from property map.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.this is not directly related with a problem, but instead of maintaining file and doing io operation, passing config object on-the-fly would be more suitable on my scenario. then I wanted to ask to maintaniers about this.Describe the solution you'd like.My solution would be to as follows, adding additonal if statement to check object is passed or not.Describe alternatives you've considered.I am currently overriding this method and using this RegionFactory.

Similarly, if there is no string between {and} (i.e. abc{}xyz), use the whole key too.Actual behavior.Exception.Steps to reproduce or test case.I suggest to modify org.redisson.cluster.ClusterConnectionManager.calcSlot(java.lang.String) like this:
Strange characters on value when read data in other language.Hey there!I was wondering if it's possible to perform a simple operation like we do on Redis StackExchange (c#) client:Right now I'm using a Map but I would like to make it simple as this example on C#.When I try to retrieve values fro other clients like C# or Python, I got some strange characters on value like myv alue.Is there any option to clear/remove those characters on Redisson and store it as plain string?Is there any option to store it simple as we do in C#?
Getting Register a custom serializer implementing instantiate or define empty constructor - redis cache on wildfly.Hello, When I deploy my code on Wildfly-19 with Redisson client to connect to Redis cluster. I am getting below error.Here is my redis configuration.
Getting too many cache misses and high cache put after a period.Our solution uses Redisson configuration with a programmatic cache creation using org.redisson.jcache.JCacheManager with a single Redis server.Caches are created with cache-api configuration and a ExpiryPolicy.When the application loads for the first time, caches started to be used and for a period they work as expected with high cache hits.After a period of tests, one (or many) caches start "deteriorating" and cache miss ratio starts to be higher. Cache put time also started to be very high.We have a screen showing cache statistics. This is one example of statistics after the problem occurs.At the example, all other caches of same type are working as expected. Just "Usuario.funcionalidades" is having the problem.The problem always happens with a nested collection in a Hibernate entity.Have you seen similar behavior? Any clues about how to understand better what is happening?

For the expire method of some RExpirable instances, there should be a bug.For example, RedissonRateLimiter has 3 keys: getName(), getValueName(), getClientValueName(), but expire only sets the expiration time of the getName() key in the parent class. And there is no overwrite expire method in RedissonRateLimiter.Expected behavior.

Retry Attempt in Redisson.I went through the below mentioned documentation .What I understood is, the redisson client will try to retry to execute the command according to this configuration, correct me if I am wrong.But what I want to ask is , will it also retry to create the client connection while starting up the application according to this configuration?I tested it by shutting down the redis server and then started the application . It is throwing exception as expected like.But nowhere I see in the log regarding retry attempts.It would be helpful if you can shed some light on it.Redis version.5.0.Redisson version.3.12.5.
RedisTimeoutException while processing task polled from blocking queue within the same CompletionStage.Hello,I created two simple tests (in Kotlin but its pretty straightforward to be translated in Java):And a second one:I had the expectation that these two tests will work more or less in the same way (i.e. I expected that both tests will pass). Surprisingly first test fails after running several times in the loop . It fails with:The only difference between these two tests is the async function composition. First test uses thenAccept and second one uses thenCompose, i.e. the difference is in the CompletionStage. Is it expected that first test should fail?
Reasoning behind returning false on RSemaphore.Why do methods such as trySetPermits only return false when the attempt fails?

RedisTimeoutException on ElastiCache being called by Kubernetes.Hey there!We moved our code to production and we are facing a lot of timeout errors:It's happening for GET and PSETEX commands. I have found the FAQ with possible solutions like increase nettyThreads and I was wondering if our problem is related with FAQ instructions - our code is super simple, it's a spring boot application with the following implementation:For now, we don't have massive requests, probably it's missing some configuration or just update Redisson Client because we are using a super outdated version 3.5.6.Do you have any other suggestion behind update lib? Do you know if is possible set nettyThread using application.properties?
RedissonResponseTimeoutException in HSCAN.The application is throwing RedissonResponseTimeoutException. It is happening when Redisson fires HSCAN command because the code is iterating over HashMap with size of 8.5k entries.

Only a single pod is working using Redis Clustered Mode.Hey there!I'm running Clustered Redis on AWS ElastiCache with 3 shards, 6 nodes (cache.m5.large) and using engine 5.0.6. Today, I was facing a lot of RedisTimeout error so I have choosed to upgrade Redisson from version 3.5.6 to 3.13.2.The timeout error were gone but now I'm facing a strange behaviour.My application is running on Kubernetes (it starts with 3 pods and can scale up) but only a single pod is working correctly with Redis, the others pods are throwing some exceptions like:Usually, this exception is throwed when the app make a request to cacheServiceImpl.get("<key>").The code is super simple, I'm using RBucket to read and insert data:And for Redisson configuration, I'm using the following: I'm assuming that Redisson is using default values for other attributes. As host, I have tried the cluster endpoint and a specific node endpoint but both cases fail with same excepion.Any idea where can I look or what can I change in configuration to make it work?Thanks in advance.

Redis stream - Can we return Flux instead of Mono?Redission library is great!  Stream is not exactly like pub/sub. But they do have some similarities.So, like pub/sub, Can the stream return the flux of messages to make it more reactive style?
RRatelimiter-Can the method of delete and trySetRate support in a transaction?Problem:In a production environment, we often deploy more than one application for high availability (HA). There are two steps: delete and trySetRate when update the RRatelimit object. In HA architecture, there will be such a situation: application 1 delete the object when application 2 trySetRate it,  therefore application 1 will update failed.The solution i would like is support the update operation(delete and trySetRate) in a transaction.The alternatives I have used in my project is locking object globally when update it.Redisson Version: 3.13.0.
(XREADGROUP) in redisson-spring-data cause READONLY You can't write against a read only replica.Expected behavior.I start to use redis stream as a mq to send log record,  I add a record to the stream in client service , when I try to get the log record from the redis stream I got the exception.What I Think.From #2663, and redis website, the command XREADGROUP.XREADGROUP is a write command because even if it reads from the stream, the consumer group is modified as a side effect of reading, so it can be only called in master instances.#2663 fix  redisson/src/main/java/org/redisson/RedissonStream.java method readGroupAsync, so I think maybe org.redisson.spring.data.connection method xReadGroup.should change to use the write operation.Actual behavior.add a record using redis stream api.try to get the stream message use StreamMessageListenerContainer  and StreamListener.

Watchdog for RSemaphore.RLock is great mechanism for distributed locking since it has a watchdog for releasing lock when client application is dead.However, when it comes to reactive version (RLockReactive) it becomes totally unuseful because unlocking can be done only by the thread that performs locking. And with reactive streams this never happens for sure.Instead, it is suggested to use RSemaphore as an alternative since it is not bound to threads. In general, it does the job. However, when client application becomes dead, already performed lock hangs forever. Setting key expiration time partially solves the problem, however, actual atomic operation time may differ, so it is usually difficult to choose the correct timeout.Another option is a watchdog, but apparently Redisson one does not work with RSemaphore.So, is it possible to configure the Redisson watchdog for prolonging RSemaphore expire time? Or the only way out is implementing own watchdog?

In this example I only have sId and type but no id , no rId, no ac etc. As I stated, If I try to getAc() a NullPointerException is thrown. Of course it's not limited to this fields only. Sometimes it's other fields that are missing. Sometimes I get a fully empty object like this one:Steps to reproduce or test case.I guess use the same object as me.It might be important to know that I'm inserting those object concurrently(different objects though - no two objects with the same id at the same time).Hope you can help!

Distributed exclusive task with Redisson?I'm using Redisson distributed executor service. A task class A is designed to process a given queue identified by its queue ID. There are multiple such queues. I need to ensure for any time in the cluster, there are no more than one instance of task class A that works on the same queue.Allowed:Task class A instance1 working on queue1.Task class A instance2 working on queue2.Not allowed:Task class A instance1 working on queue1.Task class A instance2 working on queue1.There are a large number of such queues and they change dynamically. So pre-allocation of task instances may not be an option, because the queue ID is dynamic.How can this be achieved with Redisson executor? If not directly, can this be achieved with some distributed lock or queue?I have the same question on Stackoverflow as well:

Reads only happening from Master Node for Hibernate L2 Cache in Elastic Cache replicated mode.Redis Setup:Nodes: 1 Primary and 2 Replica Nodes.002 is Primary, rest 2 are replica node.What I want to acheive.I want to configure Redis as a distributed l2 cache to improve my application's performance as ~70% of my traffic is read only. I am using hibernate as my ORM, thus don't want to write lots of custom code when there is a standard implementation provided by redisson.Issue:I see all the cache hits are from the master node meaning every write, as well as read, is just happening from the master node.I went through all the issues reported till now to find the solution but none of them were around hibernate l2 cache. Finally found #2165 where its mentioned "RMapCache.get operations modifies data so it can't use slave node. This method updates idletimeout and lasttimeaccess parameters per entry.You could use RMap object in this case.".And After looking at the code here I found we are using RMapCache<Object,Object> for each region.This indicates we can't use it correctly for Hibernate L2 Cache as every time I try to fetch a cached object, redisson will write to the master node and my entire traffic will become dependent on a single master node. Which is not very reliable.Please help with this.Proof.Cache Hit Rate: You can clearly see its just hitting primary node.Cache Hits: You can clearly see its just hitting primary node.Cache Misses:Happy to provide more details.
Classloading issues with jboss-marshalling and redisson-tomcat.Expected behavior.When using redisson-tomcat to provide a SessionManager for our tomcat installation, we expect the classloader used to instantiate objects should be the current thread classloader, regardless of which Codec is being used. Using FSTCodec this worked as expected. This is to allow the right classloader, Tomcat vs WAR classloader to create the objects which it knows how to create.Actual behavior.After the switch to the MarshallingCodec as default we are running into issues with the RiverUnmarshaller is throwing errors after calling classResolver.resolveClass(). When a thread from my WAR attempts to unmarshall a class it has loaded, for example org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.DefaultSavedRequest the classresolver on the RiverUnmarshaller for some threads points to tomcat’s Classloader (URLClassLoader with apache-tomcat paths)This RiverUnmashaller is a FastThreadLocal<Unmarshaller> decoderThreadLocal which is field on the MarshallingCodec.I can see in the debugger that the MarshallingCodec has classLoader field of my WAR’s class loader, not a reference to tomcat’s. The configuration object on the same MarshallingCodec also points to the WAR class loader.The number of threads in this broken state where the classloader being used to unmarshall isn't shared by the MarshallingCodec seems to change on each run, but reproduced pretty consistently.Steps to reproduce or test case.Running Tomcat 8.5.57.0, deploy a WAR with a context xml with a manager as described.Place objects onto the session and attempt to retrieve them that are instances of classes not on the tomcat classpath directly (only within the war, spring security for example)See requests fail sometimes, depending which thread picks up the work.

HA Failover: Redisson client maintaining the connection with the previous node, unable to read/write to redis.Facing the following issue during HA testing the application wtih Redisson Client:Steps:Kill one of the masters, the slave becomes the master.Make the master up after a minute, it then becomes the slave.Kill the master node(which was slave), the slave becomes the master.Sometimes its not reproducible in one shot, need to do this 3-4 times.At this point, redisson is not able to read/write anything to that redis partition  because the client is still taking the previous master(which was killed) and not the promoted slave node.As per below logs, port 8000 was the master node, which was killed, and the slave node 9000 was promoted to master. But still Redisson is sending the command to the previous master node. We need to restart the application to make it working or make the previous master up.

Master rediss: has changed ip from IP1 to IP2.Unable to find master entry for host/{IP1}:port. Multiple IP bindings for single hostname supported only in Redisson PRO!I saw in response to a similar issue the recommendation to disable DNS monitoring. I tried to prototype (with 3.13.3) on a local PC using the hosts file to simulator a DNS change. But Redisson continues to use the earlier resolved IP address instead of resolving the hostname again. I confirmed with InetAddress.getByName() that I can retrieve the updated IP address, but Redisson is still trying to use the old one.I also tried to detect the connection drop when the IP changes (using ConnectionListener) and then completely recreate the Config and RedissonClient objects with the hostname, but still the older IP is used, and shown in the exception after failure to connect. I guess it remains cached somewhere?Is there any way to force a new attempt to resolve the IP?
Delayed queue cannot store data in the target queue on time in cluster mode, but it is normal in single mode.In cluster mode, delayed queue can't put the data to the target queue on time. The timeout data will be put into the target queue when the next offer is made.
why RedissonBoundedBlockingQueue pollAsync(int limit) not call redis incrby to increase the queue capacity?I use the RedissonQueue 'pollAsync(int limit)' method, after i poll some elements, the capacity of the queue did not recovery, at last, the capacity becomes 0, wow , i can not offer element any more!!

When performing failover, RedisConnectionException is thrown when accessing the cache after failover.Regarding #2932, when we confirmed the effect using 3.12.3, the phenomenon was not resolved.After the failover is complete, access to the new master keeps failing.Could you please provide the conditions and details of the bugs that have been corrected?I don't know if it is related to this case,I'm currently using it in a non-cluster mode configuration where Redisson's addNodeAddress specifies the primary endpoint of the node group.According to the issue below, you are asked to specify the endpoint of each node.Is it related to this phenomenon?As a test, I fixed it so that the endpoint of each node was specified, and the phenomenon that it continued to fail after failover did not occur.
Request retry very quickly and slows down response handle.Expected behavior.one GET command results in one tcp request and done.Actual behavior.one GET command results in tens of tcp request.Steps to reproduce or test case.very hard to reproduce, don't know what caused this.tcpdump below is from a container without error log now(used to have 2 days ago), the application execute scheduled task every 30 seconds so more easy to analyze.in some application, this causes to much request and finally command timeout:
Correct way for scan via reddison client.Hi!I wan't to use redis scan operation via redisson (like in Jedis).I'm checked next solution.For example, i have 3 objects inside Redis and want to retrieve only 2.But instead of retriving 2 objects, getKeysByPattern("some-pattern", 2) returns all keys from redis.This behaviour is correct?Anyway, i'am trying to use SCAN operator via Lua scripts.And this aproach is working one.But why keys.getKeysByPattern(pattern, count) returns all keys instead of count?
Does redisson work with tomcat singlesignon valve.Hi,If we have configured the org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn valve in our application, does Redisson push the ssoId also to Redis? Do we have to make any other configuration changes other than what's mentioned in redisson-tomcat Readme for this to work?Thanks.
Running into RedisTimeoutException when using Redisson, ElastiCache in AWS lambda when high traffic comes in.Hi.We are using Redisson to connect to ElastiCache to get RBucket in the AWS lambda. The trigger of the AWS lambda is a SQS(with batch size 10). The logic for this lambda is to get the RBucket for each message from SQS.(Redisson.get(BUCKET_KEY))When traffic is low, no exception happens(TPS is around 50), but when traffic becomes higher(Max TPS is around 900), the invocation and concerencent number for lambda function is getting higher, and then some RedisTimeoutExceptions are thrown by Redisson. Therefore, the backlog of the SQS is increasing.Here is the detailed Exception log when executing Redisson.get():Here is the current Redisson Config, the other.Here are some question I want to get cleared:I'm wondering what the detailed root cause for org.redisson.client.RedisTimeoutException: Command execution timeout for . Is that means the Redisson configtimout is shorter than expected? But I think purely increasing the timeout seems cannot scale up the capacity to handle the high TPS.To resolve this issue, how can I modify the Redisson Config to handle such a high traffic? I followed the Redisson FAQ to scale up the config, but not sure how to come up with a suitable config.

Tomcat session manager requires serialization or is this a bug?After successfully setting up Redisson as Tomcat session manager I get the following exception when trying to access the application:I also received another exception pointing to jboss-Marschalling also in regards to NotSerializableException.As far as I understood the documentation, it would not be required to fix application code to move tomcat sessions to Redis via redisson. Am I wrong with my assumption?Trying to solve this issue with different codecs did not work either.
Store a Map<String,SomeObject> in Redis DB from one process and access from another with Redis DB.Hi,Is it possible to find an example where a Redisson Map<String,SomeObject> is serialized to the Redis DB by a process P1. This Map is then accessed in another process  P2, also P2 should get notified about the updates made to this map by Process P1.Any pointers to get started with this?I see MapWriter example on Wiki. Does that example assume Oracle DB beneath?
Redis LiveObject Bulk Initialization.Hi There,I am using Redis library in my application.Now I am planning to use RLiveObjectService  for search page (instead of DB will read from Redis Cache).I do see that there are methods available  in RLiveObjectService for find , get , detele and instert to update Cache.I am looking for method like mergeAll or persistAll using which I can initialize cache during application startup.Is there any way to achieve this.?Thanks in Advance.
Deletion RMap key by pattern.Hi guys,I stumble upon a weird issue for my project. I am trying to delete RMap key by a pattern. I follow the documentation and it seems I could do that by getting the keyset and passing the pattern, and delete the found keys via the fastRemove method.However It does not work for me.I am using redisson library version 3.12.3 for Java, and the cache is deployed through elastic cache AWS.The setup is like the following:the RMap name is jsonCollectionV3 and the item key inside the map I tried to delete is 100011176limit5offset2 the pattern I am using is 100011176*.Please find below the code I am trying to use to fetch the key pattern from the map and using the fastRemove to delete the key retrieved.However as per log below and entry in Redis desktop manager, the key is not removed from the map, the size still one.If you guys can help me point out where did I do wrong, that will be great! thanks a lot. I have tried changing the key format for storing the records and it is not working as well.

a question about lock acquisition.I have a question about lock acquisition.assume two services A and B acquire locks to access shared resources.A has acquired the lock.When B tries to acquire the lock. it will find the lock is held by other service(A).So B will subscribe to the channel, for acquiring the lock.before B subscribe to the channel,A release the lock and publish some messages.What happens next?B is waiting for the messages that is published by the lock holder(A), but A has published the messages and released the lock.How did you solve it?I'm sorry I didn't understand the source code,Thank you very much for your work.

Why doesn't the redisson connections reconnect after the network recovery.Expected behavior.After the network between redisson and redis server recoveried from disconnection, Redisson is able to open a healthy connection pool to each of the nodes.Actual behavior.Connection never recover until we restart the service. This situation  Occasionally happens.Error Log.We only log the exception message like this.I am curious about some question:why some log shows "after 0retry attempts"? Does the retryAttempt not work?What's the meaning of the freeConnectionsCounter and freeConnectionsAmount in the log? The value of  freeConnectionsCounter in the log is 1100 and even bigger than the connectionPoolSize, is that ok?why the connection never recover?

Is there a fast and efficient way to get a count of all entries in a RMultimap?With a regular RMap the size() is very quick and efficient but it doesn't seem that there is a way to get the total size of a multimap in the same way. What I mean by total size is the sum of sizes of all of the values (collections) of a multimap.
Understanding sizeInMemory.I'm wondering what exactly is reported by sizeInMemory() method. The doc says it is "Returns bytes amount used by object in Redis memory".I'm looking at the numbers this method reports say for the RSet of strings and it is much smaller than byte count of the strings stored in the RSet. Does it mean that the data is stored compressed in REDIS?Also is my understanding correct that for RSetMultimap to find the total size of it in memory one needs to add value returned by sizeInMemory() for the map itself and then the value returned by sizeInMemory() for all of the RSets stored in that map?
`RMultimap.sizeInMemory()` method doesn't take in account size of all associated objects.Expected behavior.Actual behavior.Steps to reproduce or test case.

Allow RedissonClient construction with no redis availability.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.This is for SingleServerConfigs.Occasionally during deployment the redis instance comes up after our services. When injecting RedissonClients using Spring @bean or CDI @produces, the RedissonClient dependency will fail with an exception upon construction.Describe the solution you'd like.When your connection pool minimums are set to 0, RedissonClient instances should be able to be constructed without redis being available.Any operations with no connections in the pool should attempt a connection. Failing that, fail accordingly. It would be nice to have a "target pool size" in addition to an actual minimum- so that I can have a minimum of 0 but aim to have 10 or more, etc.Describe alternatives you've considered.We'd have to inject some form of Supplier instead, this is not ideal. The client is the owner of the pool, us doing that is taking on those connection pool management concerns.

tomcat-redisson session.getAttributeNames not honoring loadedAttributes.Expected behavior.When using readMode=REDIS and updateMode=AFTER_REQUEST.session.getAttributeNames() should include "a".Actual behavior.session.getAttributeNames() does not include values cached in loadedAttributes map, and goes directly to redis, which has not yet received the new information.Steps to reproduce or test case.see 86ac2aa for work around that solved the issue.
tomcat-redisson session expiration for active session on another server.Expected behavior.When a session is present on multiple tomcat servers, it should not expire and be removed from redis until the last accessed time in redis is old enough to be considered expired.Actual behavior.the last accessed time in memory on each server is checked, and if any of them are old enough, the session is deleted from redis.Steps to reproduce or test case.So we've run into a different issue around expiring sessions.The scenario where we ran into this problem was with readMode=Redis and broadcast mode off, but it may exist with it on also.user interacts with server 1.network partition/round robin loadbalancing makes a the next request to server 2 for a short period of time.user interacts with server 1 again (partition over or dynamic load balancing)user's in memory session on server 2 will expire prior to their actual session expiration since the last access time in memory on server2 is older than server1 or in redis itself.server 2 expires the session which triggers a delete call, removing the session from redis, even if they were still active on server 1.our tests, which have diverged a little from master looks along the lines of:so before we expire any session, we make sure that the last accessed time is accurate.
RedissonSession map doesn’t have expiration after changeSessionId is called.We noticed a large number of keys in our Redis server had no TTL set and traced it back to the RMap that backs the session.
Key prefix or custom key serializers.Our company have redis cluster for multiple Springboot apps. We use different redis key prefix between every app by a key serializer, like this:Now, when we use RedisTemplate to do everything, the key was added a prefix by serializer.

RObjectLiveService # delete: Incorrect representation obtained by the proxy's RObject getName method.Expected behavior.Getting the correct object identifier to remove it.Actual behavior.There is incorrect behavior when calling RLiveObjectService # delete (T) where T has a name field with an appropriate getter and setter.Steps to reproduce or test case.Create simple entity.Persist and delete entity.See throwed exception:in new RedissonKeys(ce).deleteAsync(map.getName()) because the proxy object calls its own RObject # getName method, which corresponds to the entity getter, and returns null. Also with the specified value, the entity is not deleted.Solutions to the problem:check the object for system getters and setters that the proxy object has before loading the class into the cache and registering it in the context.check the object for system getters and setters, and, if any, generate additional utility methods.

ElastiCache fail over with primary/reader endpoints not working with replicatedServersConfig.I'm currently working with an ElastiCache Redis Cluster (cluster mode disabled) and I have 3 nodes (1 primary node and 2 replica nodes). I'm working with an application configured with the Redisson Tomcat Session Manager. I'm currently testing the ElastiCache failover. I had to set the retryAttempts to 30, the retryInterval to 1000, and use the 3 node endpoints in the nodeAddresses, but with that I'm able to successfully fail over the ElastiCache cluster without disrupting the application. However, if I use only the primary endpoint (master) and the reader endpoint (replica) in the nodeAddresses an ElastiCache fail over disrupts the application. Are the primary/reader endpoints not supported with the replicatedServersConfig?
CPU Load on RedissonMap.get/put.Good afternoon. Help to understand the problem of high processor load.

Can't read after write when data is large.Expected behavior.read success after writing into Redis when data is large.Actual behavior.can't read data after writing into Redis using redisson when data is large.Steps to reproduce or test case.We have a social service in our app, and we store the follower list in the Redis.When I follow a user, I will delete the follower list of this user on Redis, next time when I load the follower list, I will load data from MySQL first, then call RScoredSortedSet.addAll() to add data to Redis, then call the RScoredSortedSet.valueRangeReversed() to get the data with start and limit.If a user has a little follower list lower than 1000, it will succeed. But when more than 3000, it will return null first time, and will.return the correct list the second time.It seems like a consistency issue, but we use the cluster, which will only read data from the master node.

It seems to broadcasting session creation between several tomcat with netty 4.1.52 even if broadcastSessionEvents="false".I have memory leak issue as I posted #3087.So, I update netty version 4.1.52 according to #1975.This won't happen if I use redisson-all-3.13.5.jar from url below.Here is my pom.xml making my own redisson-all-3.13.5 to update netty.

LocalCacheMap key add or remove notification.Hi, I would like to use a LocalCacheMap to cache collections of objects, and reduce the number of requests to redis.  Our use case is one where keys are added or removed infrequently, but we iterate over the entire collection very frequently.If I understand it correctly, the LocalCacheMap does not add new keys to the local cache when they are added to redis by another application using a LocalCacheMap instance, which means that when we iterate over the collection it requires a SCAN redis command, which is a round trip redis operation.Is there a way to update the local cache when object are added to the redis cache?  If there were, it seems like it would eliminate the need for the redis SCAN command when iterating.Alternatively, is there a way to add an EntryCreatedListener, similar to other collection types?  Or piggy back on the LocalCacheMap's own listener to achieve the same?  If I could do that I would then know all the keys to iterate over the collection.thanks, Mitchell.
Failed to switch to the Redis instance during ip address change in DNS.Connect to the Redis instance when it is ready after an ip change in DNS.Failed to connect to the new Redis instance forever even if the new Redis is up and running.The problem is in the two classes:In function 'monitorMasters' in DNSMonitor.java, there are two lines:The changeMaster(...) is asynchronized call without return value. So regardless successful or not, the master list is changed to the new Redis.The fix can be to add a return value to changeMaster(...), and only when the connection to the new Redis is setup successfully then change the masters list. Otherwise, retry to connect to the new Redis until it is available.
The RSet in RSetMultimap doesn't prevent logically equal objects from being stored in it.I'm not sure if this is by design or a bug so posing this as a question.For the following code:the test will fail.Of course if you read the set by calling getAll() it will have only one entry but the duplicates will be stored in the REDIS memory.Is there a way to enforce uniqueness on put?Thank you.

response has been skipped due to timeout! for PING command.Redisson version: 3.12.4.We are seeing warning log in our production logs.response has been skipped due to timeout! channel:We have enabled keepAlive and set pingConnectionInterval to 5 seconds to keep the connection alive which was suggestion given for another question last year. Looks like this background PING command has 1 second timeout instead of using timeout configuration, can you confirm?Looks like these timeouts happen on connections running BLPOP command, in that case can you skip doing PING on blocked connections?We also gave netty threads equal to max number of connections in the pool, this value varies by service 64, 128, and 256.

High contention on AsyncSemaphore.Hi,We have a cluster of services that extensively use Redisson 3.13.4. But CPU load and throughput are not equal for all instances. We found that the bigger CPU, then bigger latency and lower throughput. The main difference of such instance is in high contention on AsyncSemaphore object. Is it possible to reduce it somehow? For example, use few connection pools, instead of one or we need to use few Redisson clients?Here is for comparison node with high and low CPU:Stack trace from profiler in netty thread:Thanks!
Redisson upgrade 3.9.1 -> 3.13.4 increased number of Redis processed commands.Hi,After upgrade Redisson client from 3.9.1 to 3.13.4 we noticed significantly increased number of processed commands in Redis.

WeightedRoundRobinBalancer filtered any Master node because it has freeze status.I configured master-slave configuration for standalone Redis.I added master to balance map.When I switched on the monitor on Redis I see that on master there aren't any read requests from my application.In WeightedRoundRobinBalancer balancer I found that code:Why a master node always filtered here? It's a mistake?
Redisson don't switch read operation properly when slave is down.I configured master-slave configuration for standalone Redis. readMode = ReadMode.MASTER_SLAVE.When I do on slave debug segfault there aren't operations in a monitor on a master node. Only after timeout in 180000 ms all operations will start to perform on the master node. My code didn't receive any exception from Redisson.I can reduce a delay by setting up failedSlaveCheckInterval = 3000 parameter but why Redisson didn't switch to slave after the first failed command?And that more important why Redisson didn't send any command to the master node?

RMapCache.keySet inconsistent behaviour.Hello,I am using redisson 3.12.5.I have this map "REMOTE_SESSIONS" and I am trying to access it using getMapCache ( RMapCache )After fetching the map I am querying it's keys , using keySet but I am seeing inconsistent behaviour and I am not sure why.I might be using the library wrong but this is driving me crazy :)Here is my code.I am doing the following:Get 10 instances of REMOTE_SESSIONS cache. For each of them print the count given by size and then the actual count , retrieved via iterator traversal.And I get the following output:For some reason the actual content of the keySet is varying. This might be related to the fact that under the scenes this is implemented using HSCAN but can't really tell why.Any idea why this is happening and can I access the keys from a map.My end goal would be to query the keys using a pattern but that doesn't work consistent either.Any help is greatly appreciated.Thanks.

incremental number of connection over time.we face a problem that number of connection to Redis cluster node is increasing until it consumed the max number of open connections (which was set to 4096)After a period of running the client, we discovered that number of connections from client to a single redis node (slave one) using lsof is more than 100 connections in some cases it exceeded 200 connection despite the configs are set to 64 (see the attached connections.log for open connections from client to redis node)Is that a connection leak problem or a configuration issue?

Question on queues and detailed documentation on RStream.Hi, I'm a fairly new user of Redisson and have a question regarding queues and streams in Redisson.I'm evaluating whether I could/should use RStream or not but unfortunately the documentation and examples I found are very short and didn't come with much explanation of the used methods/parameters and the reasons why.My use case is fairly simple and could be managed with a queue but I want to make sure an element pulled from the queue was processed by an ack or something similar to prevent data loss in case of a failure.I found this question on StackOverflow which is basically the same problem I have:But unfortunately it's basically a monologue by the person asking without a final answer or solution.Basically I am not interested in features like consumer groups etc. and I'd already be happy if I could have something like in the following example:Would you recommend using RStream for this use case or is there a better way to achieve what I want with Redisson?If I can use RStream for this is there a simple example to get RStream working like a RQueue with acks?Could you provide a more detailed documentation on RStreams?Thank you!

Rx API is missing support for cache variants of multimaps.Context description:The regular (non-async, non-reactive, non-Rx) API contains cache variants for multimap based collections:But the Rx-ified version of the API does not have the cache variants:Our problem:The problem we are facing is that we have a code base that heavily relies on Rx interfaces and that we need the expiration/eviction functionality that Redisson offers for set multimaps, but this combination seems to be missing from the API.Desired solution.Additions to the Rx-ified API to be able to instantiate multimap caches, so that we can specify expiration for items in the multimap cache using Rx method calls.Alternatives we've considered.We've considered using the non-Rx-ified APIs, but we'd end up writing our own Rx proxy layer around it since our code base so heavily relies on RxJava. Therefore it seems more logical to add it to Redisson instead, even more so because it looks as though this feature would fill a rather obvious gap in the API (for which there was understandably no time yet, undoubtedly).

How to get RLock list? Rkeys is not work.Rkeys does not contains RLock keys.  Only me?
Class cast exception when working with RMapCache<String, String>.I have this RMapCache<String, String> stored in redis.

Implement a reliable RQueue with an ack() method.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.I initially discussed this idea in #3136.Describe the solution you'd like.I'd like an RQueue implementation that allows to ack() elements to improve reliability and ensure that an object has been processed by one of the queue's consumers. The following example demonstrates the feature request:If the consumer that q.poll()ed the element crashes or shuts down before finishing the processing and calling q.ack(), the element will automatically be "unlocked" for another consumer to poll next (e.g. via a watch dog similar to RLocks).Describe alternatives you've considered.As shown in #3136 I considered using RStream but decided against doing so because the RStreams are far too complicated for simple use cases with only a small number of consumers.My current solution involves using q.pollLastAndOfferFirstTo(...) and creating locks for the elements that should be marked as in progress to check whether the consumer working on an element is still alive or not. This also involves a periodic task that performs such a check on all items in the "in-progress-queue". This works but it would be great if this could be a feature of Redisson so I could reduce my code to someting similar as shown in the small example above.
Redisson RMap isEmpty() returns unexpected result.I have a map stored in redis cluster. When I try to get this map to know if a given key exists in it, I am using.It works at most times. But somehow the RuntimeException I defined above will be throw out sometimes unexpectedly. Which means rMap.isEmpty returns true with no exception, while the fact is we do have this key stored in redis.In addition, I found a exception in another thread,Does this exception impact the result when I was calling `rMap.isEmpty()'?  And how can I avoid this problem?

Add property to disable redisson in spring boot.Hi!Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.We use redisson with spring-boot-starter in our project. Unfortunately, sometimes we need to disable caching (f.e. on some environments we don't have redis). When it comes to a spring-data-redis we can just set property:spring.cache.type: NONE.and caching is disabled, but if we use Redisson then his auto-configuration doesn't let us run the application without a worked Redis connection.Describe the solution you'd like.Disable the whole auto-configuration when.spring.cache.type: NONE.Describe alternatives you've considered.We can add a new maven profile and exclude the redisson dependency but it doesn't sound well because we get a new profile to maintain.My current solution.I excluded autoconfigurations:I made my own auto configuration (based on redisson's autoconfiguration) where I've added.If you agree then I will push a pull request with changes.
redisson-tomcat does not persistent attribute changes properly using updateMode AFTER_REQUEST.Session attributes modified without calling setAttribute are not stored properly in Redis.The following snippet sets an empty list as a session attribute ("foo") on the first call. Any subsequent call gets the attribute and appends an item ("bar") to the list without calling setAttribute.Expected behavior.With updateMode AFTER_REQUEST the changes should be persisted to Redis after each request regardless of the missing setAttribute.So the list should expand by one item on every call.

Add a possibility to work with RLocalCachedMap reactively.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.In highload systems, it may be too expensive to make requests to Redis too often. Using a not reactive approach, it's possible to enable local caching and use RLocalCachedMap to reduce amount of requests to Redis. However, in a reactive system, currenty it's not an option.Describe the solution you'd like.I think it would be very nice to be able to use RLocalCachedMap reactively.Describe alternatives you've considered.As an alternative, I have to implement a custom caching logic to reduce amount of requests to Redis.

How to clear Redis cache when deployed to 2 or more containers?In my Spring Boot project, I have one redis container deployed in Docker swarm cluster. I use it as Hibernate 2nd level cache for the application.

If I do that, how can I clear the cache in 2 or more containers at the same time?
Behavior of locks vs conditions like network partition.Hello everyone,Couldn't find my answer in docs or by looking briefly at the implementation, so posting the question here.Let's assume a system, where X instances of the same application are working concurrently on processing some data. In general, the instances can work concurrently, but some specific data items must not be processed at the same time by more than one instance, as this would produce race condition.To synchronize application instances and avoid race conditions, we've set up a Redis instance, and we use Redisson's locking mechanism to achieve exclusive execution. In general, the workflow for an instance looks like this:(take a lock A) -> (process data) -> (release lock A)Then, obviously, the other instances, that want to process the conflicting data item, need to wait for lock A to be released. Processing an item can take anywhere between several seconds and several days. so a lock might be held for a long time (and we use this auto-renewal feature for locks to have the lock prolonged as needed behind the scenes by Redisson).My question is - what happens if an instance, that is currently holding the lock, loses connectivity to Redis (and therefore the lock times out and is then taken by another instance), and then after some time it regains the connectivity? Will it finish processing the data without holding the lock, and then fail on releasing the lock? Or maybe something else would happen?I'd really appreciate your feedback on this.Best Regards,Paweł.

Authentication broken for Sentinel configuration.HI there,it seems like the Redisson authentication is broken for the current release 3.13.6 in combination with a Redis 6.0.9 and a Sentinel setup. I provide the password with the config object:I suspect the implementation of the checkAuth() and createRedisConfig(...) methods in SentinelConnectionManager.Since the default of usePassword is false, this results in the provided password being set to null in createRedisConfig(..), which subsequently causes checkAuth() to fail prematurely on line 213 client.connect() with a RedisConnectionException caused by an RedisAuthRequiredException. Therefore, usePassword is never set to true and the Redission Sentinel config is broken for secured Sentinel instances.
Local Cache performance : Cache Key extra operations.Hello Everyone,The Local cache map data types for key is CacheKey and for value is CacheValue. The CacheKey contains the hashed value of encoded original key object. Due to this, when ever redisson tries to retrieve from the local cache, it has to encode the key and convert to hash value and get value from the local cache.Is there any specific reason behind this approach? What if the CacheKey stores the original key directly? Will that improves the local cache performance?Best Regards.Sai.

RMap is holding huge memory compared to normal object in Redis.While working on memory improvements for Redis, I came across with an issue where I have observed that Redis is using huge memory for RMap compared to normal object.I have execute below code and I observed below things:I could see memory occupied in Redis for key abcd-abcd:map is 10728729 bytes(10.72 MB), I have used command MEMORY USAGE abcd-abcd:map.I could see memory occupied in Redis for key abcd-abcd is 1170360 bytes(1.17 MB), I used command MEMORY USAGE abcd-abcd.My question is if I am saving one object(hashmap) as an RMap and saving the same object(hashmap) as a value in another Map then why the object saved in RMap is occupying huge amount of memory compared to other case?Please note currently I kept SIZE as 100000, but in my case I need to save 1-2 million(or more than that) objects in RMap and in that case I can see huge memory utilization in Redis.Can someone please review this and share their thoughts?
Fill variables in redisson.yml with Spring Boot values.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.We are using redisson-spring-boot-starter. We were hoping that we could configure Redisson with a redisson.yml, but also configure more dynamic properties from our application.yml.When we run in a different environment we can overwrite the Redis hostname by setting an environment variable. With Spring Boot profiles (for example "local"), we could have an application-local.yml that contains the following:That way we would be able to have different configurations for our local run configuration compared to what we use in our production systems. Detailed properties for Redisson (described in redisson.yml) are the same for all environment, while things like the host, port or ssl properties can change depending on the environment where the application is running.Describe the solution you'd like.If the merging of application.yml(or application-local.yml) with redisson.yml is not possible, can we then maybe have some feature where we fill variables with Spring Boot values. That way the redisson.yml would be able to look like:In such a way, we would be able to create an application-local.yml that looks like this:With Spring Boot values I mean the values described by externalized configuration here. That way there are many ways to inject variables into the configuration of Redisson.Describe alternatives you've considered.We currently are using the following as an application.yml:This works for us but puts a lot of detail for a specific dependency in the application.yml. These fields are never changed. The values are prone to mistakes.

compatibility with spring-session 2020.0.1.i have seen on the wiki that currently redisson officially supports spring-boot up to version 2.3, the same for spring-session and spring-data. which version of reddisson library should I use when running with spring-boot 2.4.0 and spring-session 2020.0.1?
Option to store null values into the local cache.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.I have an application that is using Hazelcast "near cache" extensively and I'm evaluating a migration to Redis using Redisson "local cache" because I would like to use the AWS ElastiCache Redis service. This application does thousands of cache reads for every user request, so the "local cache" is really needed.For testing purposes, I launched the same request twice to this application using Hazelcast and twice using Redis, and I saw that the second execution time for the Redis application was higher than the second execution time for the Hazelcast application. It was very surprising considering that the second request should read the data from the "local cache" (redisson).I debugged the application code and I found that it does hundreds of cache misses. On the othe hand, I found that Redisson only updates the local cache when reading the map value from redis gives a not null value. This redisson code is in RedissonLocalCachedMap.getAsync():So, considering that our application does hundreds of cache misses and that Redisson local cache always tries to read the value from redis (even when it tried to read the same key before), it is reasonable that our application performs worse than expected.Describe the solution you'd like.In order to improve our application performance when using Redis I think that it would be helpful to be able to add null values to the Redisson local cache, maybe adding an extra option in LocalCachedMapOptions; something like cacheNullValues, with a false value by default. I think that something related was fixed in #928 and #853.Describe alternatives you've considered.I have not considered an alternative.

Redisson Semaphore Expiry Not Getting Honoured.I am trying to synchronise my APIs using Redisson semaphores. Here is the code:I have observed certain cases where the LockOn object in Redis is has its TTL set to -1. What this means that there is no TTL. But I am clearly setting it to 60s on a successful acquisition.Steps To Reproduce: This happens only for a bunch of requests and is intermittent.Redisson version: 3.13.4.
Semaphore TTL -1 In Redis Despite Explicitly Setting It.I am trying to synchronise my APIs using Redisson semaphores.

Please follow semantic versioning specification when you make big changes.This is not the first time you make a breaking change in a minor version bump!Expected behavior.We expected the minor version bump would be backwards compatible.Please refer to here:Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.Actual behavior.In your redisson-3.13.6, you made a type change:which breaks our build when we tried to bump the version.
Regression: using #del() in pipeline on clustered connection.Expected behavior.Using del() in a pipeline on a clustered connection should always execute after the earlier commands (e.g. get) in the pipeline. We're using Redisson as the connection factory for a spring-security-oauth2 token store, which uses this behavior.See previously #2680.Actual behavior.We’re getting NullPointerExceptions, because the one of the gets returns null. It looks like #3153 re-introduced this error, because it always executes del async, regardless of whether the connection is pipelined.Steps to reproduce or test case.

Client unable to discover cache node because of primary node failure.Our cache cluster has 3 shards with single master in each shard and 0 slaves.Expected behavior.When the Redis cluster node fails aws(elastic cache for redis) will create a new node and replace the failed node. After the replacement is successful client should be able to discover the new node again.Actual behavior.Redisson client is unable to discover the new node. And all the calls are failing until we force the re creation of the client from the start.Steps to reproduce or test case.We are working on AWS ElastiCache for Redis.Our cache cluster has 3 shards. Each shard has 1 master and 0 replication nodes.When one of the shard’s primary node fails(happens in case maintenance) all the calls which get directed to that particular shard fail after that.This behaviour is observed only when there is some traffic at the time of node failure. If there is no traffic at the time of node failure the client seems to work perfectly fine and serve requests at later time.I have observed the following log statements:Not really sure why a slave with same address is getting added and removed.My guess is it is removing the wrong node.

Would be nice to have a way to extend the TTL on an RLock.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.I have some situations where I'd like to keep the lock acquired for potentially a long time, but I don't find out until I've held it for a while.  I don't want to set a long TTL because I might finish soon; I basically need to extend the acquisition of the lock in increments.Describe the solution you'd like.A simple RLock.setNewTTL() method, or similar.Describe alternatives you've considered.https describes how this can be accomplished by sending a Lua script:If the work performed by clients is composed of small steps, it is possible to use smaller lock validity times by default, and extend the algorithm implementing a lock extension mechanism. Basically the client, if in the middle of the computation while the lock validity is approaching a low value, may extend the lock by sending a Lua script to all the instances that extends the TTL of the key if the key exists and its value is still the random value the client assigned when the lock was acquired.It would be nice if Redisson's RLock API could take care of this for you.  Apologies if there's already a way to do this that I missed.

Tomcat session manager registers UsageValve with Engine pipeline.Expected behavior.Since the Manager can only be registered with a Context, the UsageValve should not be added to the Engine pipeline, but to the Context pipeline. Or the UsageValve should take into account that not all Sessions are RedissonSessions.Actual behavior.If the session manager cannot find a UsageValve, it adds a UsageValve to the Engine pipeline. The UsageValve assumes all Sessions are RedissonSessions.Steps to reproduce or test case.Have two webapps, one with the default Session Manager, one with RedissonSessionManager.Access the one with the RedissonSessionManager first.Then access the one with the default Session Manager.An internal server error is returned and the following error is logged.

Support TTL for RBuckets.set.Currently RBucket supports set with TTL.This is a request for similar support in RBuckets for setting multiple key values with specified TTL.thank you.
Can I get and update an object in an RBatch operation?Apologies if this has been asked before, or if this is the wrong forum for this kind of question.I'd like to update the timestamp field of a java object in an RBucket, keeping the object's other fields as-is.Can I do this in the context of an RBatch?  It's not super clear from the documentation I've found - I can't tell whether batching only supports pipelining a bunch of writes, or if it can do reads and then writes based on the results of those reads in a single batch operation.pseudocode for what I'm trying to do:I'm not sure if the batch will wait for the result of the read before updating it and performing the write.If this isn't the right way to do it, should I just perform a synchronous get followed by an async update?  Thank you.
redis-clusters mode with one master node crashed , why redisson client still connect the crashed node?hi ,i want to use redis-cluster and client is redisson, i ran test case as follow:step 1: run the test code;step 2: during the loop , i killed one master node (192.168.199.142:8001) .on console log : there still has command set request to  192.168.199.142:8001 node and continuous attempt try output ,  is that right or reasonable? thks.or how can i do to avoid the request to 8001 node?
Does RLocalCachedMap get invalidated with the changes in Redis-Server?Hi,My use case:I have a single node application(MyApplication) which uses RLocalCachedMap (say testMap)to communicate with redis-server and also cache data locally in aplication.On the other hand there is another Non java application say anotherApplication(which we have no control of) will update the data in redis-server on same map testMap.In which case, does RLocalCachedMap in  MyApplication will invalidate the local cache entries when there is change in redis server ?If not, how would you suggest to implement Redis Server assisted client side caching?Is there a way that i can use listen to redis-server invalidation events and keep the local cache in sync with redis-server data (with or without RLocalCachedMap as Its not mandate for use to use RLocalCahedMap). ?Please suggest.
Does a redisson retry attempt invoke the load balancer again?Given one master node and multiple replica nodes with Sentinels enabled, Redisson configured to read from replica nodes only, and round robin load balancer and retries enabled. In case of a Redisson retry attempt, does it invoke the load balancer again to determine a new replica node or does it talk to the same replica that it had unsuccessfully communicated with before?Our use case is such that we see are witnessing a 50% drop in commands processed per second when a single replica node restarts. We have retries enabled in Redisson but they don't seem to be helping so we are wondering if the retries also go to the same failing node.Redisson version: 3.13.6 Redis version: 5.0.6.The contributing guidelines dont really say anything about where to ask questions so I also created a SO question:

BiHashMap  not perform in bijection manner.Hello,Author or team member of Redission. I find a convenient util class named BiHashMap when I read source code of redisson. In my opinion, it will perform in bijection manner. I try to use it but find some problem. here are some descriptions.Expected behavior.return a value equal to  parameter which is already put into the map  when use map.reverseGet(map.get(param))Actual behavior.return a value not equal to parameter which is already put into the map  when use map.reverseGet(map.get(param))Steps to reproduce or test case.We can't guarantee all the inputs is bijective.if it should perform in  bijection manner , does it better to  use some mechanism when conflict occurs(delete illegal old data or forbid it when put operation will result in a conflict data ... )
RedissonMap.keySet(pattern, batchSizeHint).isEmpty() is inefficient.RedissionMap.isEmpty adopts the default AbstractMap.isEmpty, which checks size()==0. RedissionMap.size() iterates all keys (even with pattern), which is inefficient with large HASH.Suggest to override RedissonMap.isEmpty() which checks iterator().hasNext() instead.Not sure whether this optimization applies to other RMap implementation.

RSet broken for serializable custom pojos.Expected behavior.When working with multiple service instances and using RSet as a distributed cache, add() will create a duplicate for a custom serializable pojo even though equals() and hashCode() are implemented correctly. Also the contains() method will return false when checking the same pojo from different instances OR from the same instance with a refetched RSet like.Actual behavior.RSet's contains() method returns false. RSet's add() method will add the same object multiple times.Steps to reproduce or test case.Take any simple serializable pojo, add it to an RSet. Get the RSet again from the redission client and call its contains() or add() method with the same object. contains() will return false, and the same object will be added again.The size of the RSet will increase with each add(). Using the RSet as a constructor parameter for a native HashSet(), its size will  always be constant, since the duplicates are not added as expected.

Why does using a redisson container slow down io.netty?An Attempted Optimization:I was benchmarking an application and realized that the majority of time was being spent waiting on a jedis socket.The slowness appeared to be from the accumulated network round trip of a particular jedis call.Seems like a good use-case for a cached redisson container, so I opted for SetMultimapCache.And sure enough, it reduced the overall time spent in my function from 24% to .1%.A new problem:However this seems to have caused even more time to be spent in io.netty.  So much so that the overall duration (from the client's perspective), is significantly slower.Do you know why this is happening?  My understanding so far is that both grpc and redisson are using netty, and maybe they aren't playing well together?  Or I have some kind of bottleneck which is now being stressed further by optimizing the main worker thread.  Or I don't understand netty or redisson enough to see what's happening.Attempts to fix:I've tried to setup the resisson client in many different ways.I've tried a different number of nettythreads.  I've tried different eventloop groups with different thread counts.  I've tried changing the IO ratio to something lower/higher than 50.  If it helps, I'll show you the diff of how I integrated the container.  It basically just shows how I moved away from jedis calls in place of the redisson container:The diff shouldn't be that important, but I didn't want to leave anything out.  These are the changes I've made with the configured redisson client that result in speedup where I was trying to optimize, but signifcant slow down on the client side and increased time spent in io.netty?Do you know why this is happening?  What else can I try?

Make RxJava/Reactive libraries optional/move them to separate modules.Curently, redisson library itself is more than 2MB. When added Netty, another 2.5MB, along with RxJava, +2MB, & Project Reactor, 1.5MB, its nearly 10MB in total dependency size, even without Spring etc. I realized that both RxJava &  Project Reactor classes are not necessary for all operations, mostly has their own packages for operations/data structures etc. I believe it'd be extremely useful to move them to their own separate modules so anyone who wishes to use them, either one or both, can add specifically, but the core will be free from those dependencies & be more compact.

How to optimize slow queries by Redisson RSet.readAll() ?Hi,Recently, I used Redission RSet to save Object Collections (size from 10,000 to 40,000). When I used readAll() action to fetch all of objects in the set, it caused a lot of slow queries(cost over 100,000 microseconds).I know that storing too many objects, and that too long a key can be a performance drop, so I'd love to know how I can store so many objects and read them all efficiently with Redisson.Thanks~.Object Example:

Why not use the leasetime in the input parameter.

What's the best way to iterate through a Mapcache.Looking at this example, there are different ways to iterate though a map.In addition, I can also use Java native API.Suppose the map has millions of entries, what's the best way to iterate through the map to get all key/value pairs, without blocking Redis?My understanding is that KEYS command may block other clients, so HSCAN may be better. Does Redisson support the map iteration based on HSCAN?

The timeout configuration of MapReduce does not work.There are two data processing services here. When I use MapReduce to process data, the timeout (30 s) is set. However, when one of the services in the process of reducing data goes down unexpectedly, there is still no response from the map after the timeout, Does the data processed by the down service need to be reallocated to other machines? What is the specific meaning of this timeout? Is there something wrong with my use?The following pictures are related information:This is the normal data processing service:This is a service that has been down unexpectedly:This is the configuration code information:This is the now time:@mrniko thanks.
Redisson mapwriter.I am using RMapCache<String,Object> with map option with write mode as WRITE_BEHIND.now when i put something in cache after particular delay it is getting executed after dealy provided,but what i need is map writer should pick entry from map unless it is cache but it is not doing so it is only getting executed once.Can anyone help what can i do in this case or there is any alternative?
Spin lock with exponential backoff.RedissonLock uses pubsub mechanism to get notified about changes to lock. According to the cluster spec (https), currently messages are simply broadcasted to all nodes in the cluster. It makes this lock inefficient in clusters with more than 5 nodes.It would be great to have a spin lock with exponential backoff, because it works well with Redis's horizontal scaling.If the idea seems fine to you, I can prepare a PR in a few days, just let me know. If not - sorry for taking your time, feel free to close the feature request.Best regards,Danila Varatyntsev.

[Redis Cluster] RedisTimeoutException: Unable to acquire connection! Increase connection pool size.Expected behavior.Redisson should not exhaust the connection pool. In other words, it should release connections after every successful command.And even if the pool is exhausted that should not make Redisson freeze completely until restarted I guess.Actual behavior.We have experienced this error in production and now I have managed to reproduce the error with a clean Spring Boot project and one endpoint that executes a lua script on a redis cluster. I am using Locust (locust.io) for load testing.More on how to reproduce the error later.The screenshot shows an example Locust load test result: the first couple minutes are fine, I get around 1000 req per second and no errors.But then requests start to fail and response times go up to ~6 seconds. Sometimes it takes around 5 minutes as the test is a bit random.This is the log for one of those failed requests:Once this happens, even if you stop the test, Redisson no longer recovers. All requests fail after 6 seconds and you have to restart the server for it to work again.By the way, those 6 seconds seem to be related to retryAttempts and retryInterval settings, but even if I set retryAttempts to zero, it still takes 1.5 seconds for each request to fail. Why?Anyways, the main problem is that it fails.Steps to reproduce or test case.I have created a clean spring boot project with one endpoint that executes a lua script. The script is basically rate limiting:The endpoint just takes the IP of the request (from a "True-client-ip" header) and executes the script with it, returning the IP and the number of requests made so far this minute so you can see if it is working or not.And the test makes a bunch of requests to this endpoint, faking the True-client-ip header with 50 different IPs in an attempt to simulate a realistic environment.So, how to test:Download and extract the demo project.Change RedissonConfiguration to connect to a redis cluster. Ours has 3 master and 3 slaves.Start the server and see if localhost:8080/redisson works on your browser.Start Locust with locust -f demo.py from the root project directory (you will need to install locust with pip3 install locust)Open Locust UI on your browser (localhost:8089) and enter the following parameters:20 users, 5 spawn rate,Wait a couple minutes for the server to explode (hopefully)And those numbers probably are not even important, but now that I have managed to reproduce the error I don't want to change them.Check RedissonConfiguration for the details.

Clarification on RLocalCachedMap and CODEC Types.Hi,I am working on a API which is a high TPS one (around 10000 TPS) for both read and write.My API makes use of Redisson Open Source to connect to AWS Redis and I am making use of RLocalCachedMap so that frequently used objects will be fetched directly from LocalCache. I have the following questions:What is the unit of cacheSize? Is it the number of records. If it is number of records that this local cache can hold, then I am getting many errors related to server crash and restart if I increase the count to higher values. Each object size should be around 800 bytes. I am not sure why that is happening. Do you think it might be with the RAM of the server on which it is deployed?What happens if I dont set the cacheSize. Per documentation it is unbounded (default value is 0). So what would be the max limit this local cache size occupies and does it do the cache eviction internally if the LocalCacheMap feels the memory is nearing its capacity.This question is with respect to the Redisson default Thread Pool size. Right now, I am using the default thread pool options. Do I need to fine tune the thread pools or the default thread pools can handle 10000 TPS.This question is with respect to CODEC Types.I am having an object which has generic as one of its attribute. When I push the object to AWS Redis through redission using the codec types SNAPPYV2, SNAPPY it pushes the value and while retrieving from AWS Redis I could see the object having the values populated except the values of generics attribute (guess this codec type skips the generics at the time of deserialization). If I use JSON Jackson Codec, I could see the complete values being retrieved from AWS Redis. Would there be any codec that you suggest that handles generics or do i need to write custom serialization logic to handle.What would be the best codec type if I am going to push the object as Map<String, Object> to AWS Redis. I ran performance test with different codec types and almost each of them returned in the same time (JSON Jackson COdec being little faster).To meet the High TPS, what should be the object i need to consider while inserting it into AWS Redis, should the object be the regular POJO or can I have it as Map<String, Object>.Also, it would be helpful, if you can share any articles that helps in improving the performance using Redisson to connect to AWS Redis.
Will tasks submitted via redisson ExecutorService be executed after redis instance is restarted?It's not an issue, it's a question I have not found an answer to in documentation.Will tasks that were submitted via redisson ExecutorService be executed if redis instance is restarted?For example, a task is submitted with a delay 10mins and right after it was submitted, redis is restarted. What will happen with that submitted task?What if I have AWS ElastiCache with Redis Replication Group and Multi-AZ enabled - will that task be executed if it was successfully replicated to read instances and primary instance failed?

Dead connection stay in pool forever if server is not responding.Expected behavior.Dead Connection automatically reconnect after channel inactive.Actual behavior.In org.redisson.client.handler.CommandsQueue, we only call sendNextCommand to poll command if server responded with data or write was failed in the first place.But if client write was successful and server is not responding, our QueueCommand is still staying at the front of queue, next time we call sendData, org.redisson.client.protocol.QueueCommandHolder#trySend will return false and nothing happens.So eachtime we use that connection to write something, we got  RedisTimeoutException:  Command still hasn't been written into connection!

Connection leak when redis cluster has "127.0.0.1" in its node list.Expected behavior.An exception in adding a cluster member connection should not result in a connection leak.Actual behavior.Our redis cluster had two nodes which had configured themselves as "127.0.0.1:6379" in the cluster configuration.  Upon connecting two this cluster, redisson properly threw exception.Later in the logs we find, repeatedly.Each of these subsequent attempts appear to leave a new connection open to the redis node from which redisson is gathering cluster nodes information.  Over the course of ~2h, this used the remainder of that redis node's 10k connection limit.Steps to reproduce or test case.I'm not sure how our redis server came to this state originally, but I was able to reproduce by stopping a cluster member, changing the address field in the "myself" line in the cluster config (in our case, /var/lib/redis/redis-6379.conf) from.Where $redisHost resolves by dns to A records for each node in the redis cluster.

Redisson api reconverts Stream's linked hash maps into hash maps.Hi guys!thanks a lot for your brilliant product it helped us tremendously. However I believe that we are facing a bug there.redissonClient.getCommandExecutor().read(name, RedisCommands.XRANGE, name, "-", "+")returns LinkedHashMap.while.redissonClient.getStream(name).read(10, new StreamMessageId(0L, 0L));return HashMap, which is imo wrong.When using redis streams and XRANGE command, one wants to rely on ordering being exactly the same as ordering on StreamMessageId's.Would you have some time to check this?Thanks,

FairLock released if `lockWatchdogTimeout` is set to 100 millis.I encountered a strange behavior when lockWatchdogTimeout is set to 100 millis (I didn't test to see what exact value it starts behaving abnormally). Lock is released even if the locking thread still alive.Any value higher than this, lock is kept as long as thread is alive.Redisson version:3.15.0.I create lock in the standard way, nothing special.I have a test where I acquire fairLock instance, and perform locking.I have something like this:If lockWatchdogTimeout=100 then this test fail constantly. But if the value is set to lockWatchdogTimeout=150 then the test passes successfully.Even if I set Thread.sleep(5000); (5 seconds keeping the lock) the test still passes.Why when this configuration value set to 100, Redisson releases the lock?I'm not sure if it is a bug, but I couldn't find any documentation regarding minimum value of this config param. The default is 30 seconds and maximum is 60. But no mention of maybe it has minimum allowed in means of amount  and TimeUnit value.

How to add MapEntryListener to RMapCacheRX?I thought the xxxRx and xxx datastructures were equivalent in terms of functionality.

Redisson does not reconnect after failed DNS Monitor change.Editing and repurposing this issue after finding the underlying cause. Originally this issue was to improve the error messaging. The underlying problem is a failure to reconnect after a failed DNS change. After this scenario plays out, there are no connections in the pool, and the error message we end up seeing is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.Expected behavior.Reconnection to redis node.Actual behavior.after DNS monitor detects a change to an ip it cant reach, subsequent dns change to a good ip does not restore connections.Steps to reproduce or test case.connect to a single redis master node.add a host file entry for some bogus ip address,watch redis connection failures.remove the bogus host file entry, so that DNS monitor gets the good ip address again.re connection does not happen.
Can we set a local cache size for RSetMultimapCache?Is there a way to set an upper limit on the number of elements that are kept in the local cache?

Containers like RLocalCachedMap have clearLocalCache(), but RSetMultimapCache does not.Thanks!
Is there a simple way to change node address dynamically?I try to use redisson(3.7.0) as my redis cluster client, and I need to change the connection address of redisson dynamically, in Spring environment, is there a simple way to do that? Does it need to consider the instance with old connection's recycle?I tried to get the redisson instance directly and update the node information of its config like:but it failed(it could work sometimes).

Can you create a linked list of live objects within a live object?I have a live object that holds a linked list that holds items from another live object. I am able to push the parent live object to the redis live object service just fine. When I retrieve the parent object, the linked list is null. If I insert a string, it works just fine, but with my child live object it always returns null. See below:The variables and ID's sets removed for readability.The myObject will hold the ParentObject with the null linked list, this list is not null when sending to redis service. Also when I substitute the object type of the linkedList to String and not ChildObject, this works just fine and the list is not null. Its the nesting of the RLO within the RLO that is killing me. Any thoughts? Thanks for your time!
What's the reason for using a single pub/sub topic in tomcat RedissonSessionManager?Hi,We are currently using Redisson 3.13.6 for session management of a java web application deployed in tomcat 7 and sessions stored in ElastiCache.RedissonSessionManager is configured with readMode=MEMORY and updateMode=AFTER_REQUEST (due to the way the app is implemented this is the only configuration working for us).We noticed high network outbound traffic on a single ElastiCache node, followed by CLUSTERDOWN errors because of bandwidth throttling.I checked the implementation and found that RedissonSessionManager is implemented to use a single topic for pub/sub communication.Is there a reason for using a single topic?Is it ok to update the implementation to create multiple topics, and use a balancer when accessing them from  RedissonSession?I understand that the Redis slot is computed based on the topic name, so choosing the name for the topics in such a way that they will end up on different nodes is not that straightforward, but I am interested if there is another reason this approach might not work.Thanks,Ilie.P.S. The quick fix was to upgrade the ElastiCache node type to accommodate the traffic, but it's not ideal because of the price of the new instances and because the nodes not handling the pub/sub topic are not using these resources.

Any alternative solution to create a SQL table structure in Redis using Redisson in java app.Any alternative solution to create a SQL table structure in Redis using Redisson in java app. For example a table of say Products.The standard flow would be to instantiate a RMapCache and add the products to that - something like this.and this in Redis would result in something like this.hscan "ProductTable" 0.1) "0".While this solves the immediate problem, 2 or 3 questions arise.when doing the get command - prodRet = prodMap.get("Prod101"); - does Redis need to do a 2 step lookup - first to find the "ProductTable" and then to find the prod key within that ? is this not expensive?in a Redis cluster environment the whole "ProductTable" will end up in 1 SLOT in 1 node. So whats the use of sharding across cluster ? Yes there may be other tables that may go to other nodes but no guarantees.If someone has a better solution or better insight into this can you please share. Or am i missing something here?appreciate your help...

Handling of shard being down in a Redis cluster.Hi.Does Redisson has any logic for intelligently handling a scenario where a particular shard is down in Redis. Possible 'intelligent' solutions could be to-.Avoid calling Redis cluster for keys located over that shard.Not keep retrying for keys which are continuously failing.All these solutions may enable it to keep serving the traffic for which ever keys it can from other shards.This is possible only with some built in knowledge of key distribution across shards, I am not aware if redisson has that context ?Thanks!

Redisson and Azure Redis for Cache. Connection starvation.Hello.We're using Azure Redis for Cache which has Redis 4.0.14 under the hood with cluster configuration (number of master nodes is configurable, can be less than 3):There is scheduled maintenance on Azure which doing the following:Terminate all slave nodes.Pause 10 min.Terminate all master nodes and load balancer.We have multiple components connected to redis (9 instances) and all of them are not able to execute commands after redis outage.While redis is out of service we see following exceptions (which is okay):There is a timer (not redis-based) which every 10 secords extracts value for particular redis key.  When there are no more exceptions which looks like above, we have a lot following exceptions (as a result of GET command sent by the timer):And in a few minutes after previous exceptions operation to extract value in timer fails all the time with a little bit another exception:In the beginning we also observed following WARN which also may cause issues:Expected behavior.Connections to redis successfully restored after outage.Actual behavior.Some redis connections have closed channel and associated to particular slots. Unable to execute redis commands.Steps to reproduce or test case.Terminate slaves/masters in redis cluster configuration multiple times. Check that in connection pool all channels are not closed when redis instances will be restored.Thank you for help.

Setting TTL on existing value.We have a use case whereby when we first create objects in our Redis Hashmap, we set a long TTL (e.g. 1 month) to ensure that the data will be cleared out at some point in the future.However, in general this data is only required for a few days, and for optimization we would like to clear this data out sooner when possible. When our application is made aware that it is safe to clean up this data earlier, we would like to set a new TTL on the entries (e.g. 1 day).Unfortunately, I can't see any way to alter the TTL on an existing entry (other than doing a read, followed by a write with the new TTL).What I was looking for in the API was something similar to:or even better, a method which accepts a batch of keys.Does anything like this already exist already in Redisson? (or is there some other workaround I can use?)

Why doesn't RTransaction support passing MapOptions when creating a new RMapCache?When creating a MapCache object within a transaction, I noticed that the create methods don't support the passing of MapOptions to configure the instance.When creating from the client itself, the option is there to pass options to the method.Are the fields in the MapOptions object that are not needed in a transactional context? It looks like at least for RMapCache objects, the options field is null when it calls the superclass.

The best way to create Redisson client.Hey guys! We're using Redisson in our app and instantiating it as a Singleton. But faced some weird behavior when the Redis cluster was rebooted. We're calling the method RMap.getAll(Set<K> keys) and this time got incorrect data from Redis. Seems like some of the Redisson workers returned the requested data and other ones not.Now we're trying to create the Redisson client for each request to avoid the mentioned issue. Is it a good idea or will be better to create it one time along with the application?
Redisson Java Client-RedisCluster-YAML config-RedisNodeNotFoundException.Good morning:I have been working in the implementation of a Redisson client to connect a Java application to Redis cluster defined by a YAML config file (loaded from the Config class) and by using RBucket as a class to put and get key-value pairs.The connection is primary established by calling Redisson.create(config) method. Sometimes, even if a master is up after an outage, a RedisNodeNotFoundException exception happen saying that we need to increase the value of retryAttempts and/or retryInterval settings.I really appreciate if you can give me some advices, recommendations about some configuration fields I could have missed, or something about the uses of RBucket or Redisson.create method in order to make it more resilient and to solve that issue.Thank you so much in advance.

why can't i set expiration on RAtomicLong?I'm using Redisson 3.15.3.In my attached example you see that i try to create (or get an existing) RAtomicLong with a given name and expiration. Everything works apart from the yellow marked line where i try to set the expiration. In this concrete case expiration is 15 and unit is TimeUnit.MINUTES. But the expire() call always returns false.I'm wondering if i do something wrong or what might be common causes for expire to return false (so i could investigate those further)?
Memory leak in IdleConnectionWatcher.Hey,I have a production environment which uses a load balancer over several master Redis instances, so the actual IPs of the Redis instances switch with every request.I update Redisson from some 3.3.* version to 3.15.3 and started to notice odd memory consumption: something keeps piling up in the Old Generation and never gets garbage-collected. Normally, it would take about a day to reach Old Gen mem cap and in a few days, so when other objects make it to Old Gen, the app just dies with OOM.I dumped the memory, it looks like when IPs change, new ClientConnectionsEntry items are allocated and attached the linked queue in the IdleConnectionWatcher which is never pruned, unless the client is shut down. I can't tell how many nodes are in those queues, probably too many, because IdleConnectionWatcher is about 30Mb big.Unfortunately, I cannot change the infrastructure I use. Any chance there's any config that could just mitigate it for now?Expected behavior.Application does not run out of memory if connection entries are re-created frequently and dangling objects are cleaned up.Actual behavior.Strong references to previously created objects are retained and keep piling up until the app gets OOM-killed.Steps to reproduce or test case.Tricky: Redis instances should be behind a load balancer, which should have a resolvable hostname. The idea is to make Redisson try to rebuild the connection pool every time it makes a request.Redis version.Idk, because I don't have access to the infrastructure.

In some deployments it causes out of memory errors on our container instances.Seen both in Redisson 3.15.2 and 3.13.1. The codec is JsonJacksonCodec as you can see from the allocation call stack. So far I have only seen it with pipelined write operations (RBatch, in memory atomic). No other exceptions or errors during the write operation was seen.My question is, is there something we should be doing differently to avoid such leaks, or is this a possible bug? Any hints on where to look would be helpful. I have not been able to create a local minimal repro to share unfortunately.Recent access records:
RedissonConnection#scan query results error in redis cluster.Hi, In our test case, we store three keys that start with  test  in redis cluster, two of which are in the same node, one in the other node, and then using  RedissonConnection#scan  method to query   test*. we can only query keys on a node, not all nodes.Expected behavior.In Redis cluster mode,when we use RedissonConnection#scan to  get the keys with a pattern mode like (test*), we want to get the keys that can be matched by the pattern on all redis cluster nodes.Actual behavior.In Redis cluster mode,when we use RedissonConnection#scan to get the keys with a pattern mode like (test*) in redis instance,we can only get the keys matched by the pattern on a certain redis node.Steps to reproduce or test case.
ConnectionListener configuration.Good morning:I hope you are doing well.I would like to know which is the process or thread that is used by the ConnectionListener so that the RedissonClient reconnects to the Redis Server.I mean we can get onConnect and onDisconnect events, but I would like to know how Redisson implements reconnection mechanisms so that the listener can trigger the onConnect event.Could that mechanisms (process/thread) be configured by using the YAML config? Or have a behavioral properties set by default for all the implementations that use it?I appreciate your attention and collaboration with the related details about this topic.
Redisson scheduleWithFixedDelay job not running on the configured time.Background:Redisson version: 3.15.0.Framework: Spring Boot.Redis instance type: Cluster mode ( Azure Cache Premium with 2 nodes )I am using scheduleWithFixedDelay API of redisson to schedule two kinds of delayed jobs:repeat every 2 mins with a initial delay of 5 mins and max execution count of 5 times.repeat every 2 mins with a initial delay of 15 mins and max execution count of 10 times.I have implemented the logic for the max execution count using RAtomicLong data type.Issue.When I schedule using the executor.scheduleWithFixedDelay API, the job is not executed at the expected initial delay configured. To add some more context, I spawned multiple instances of both the delayed job types and NONE of them ran at the expected delay ( 5 mins or 15 mins). In fact, all of them ran the next day around the same time with a delay of ~8 hours from their initial creation time.On the other hand, jobs that I schedule with executor.execute API are running fine without any issues immediately. The problem is happening only with scheduleWithFixedDelay API.Below is some sample source code of roughly how the delayed jobs look like along with the redissonClient / redisson node creation code.Highly appreciate any help with this :)We felt these errors were causing the scheduleWithFixedDelay to not to work properly, so to fix these connection timeouts, we set the following params to the redisson client:pingConnectionInterval: 10000.keepAlive: true.Post doing these configuration changes, we did not notice these timeouts for 2 days and the scheduleWithFixedDelay API did work as expected. However, we started receiving these timeouts after 2 days.I wanted to know what is a right way to deal with this situation. Also, as mentioned before, this is ONLY happening for scheduleWithFixedDelay usecase and not the execute API. Why is this happening ONLY for the schedule API and not the execute API ?
Redisson cluster cannot recover from "missing slot".A test program is pushing a bunch of requests (evalSha for lock-free evaluation) repeatedly. Then bounced Redis Cluster in the middle of it. The connections were lost, then discovered within seconds, as expected. However, Redisson is stuck unable to recover from this condition:Redis cluster state is fine:Expected behavior.Eventually discover the hash slot is available.Actual behavior.Retrying the same sequence of operations does not recover even after 5 minutes.Steps to reproduce or test case.Start Redis cluster.Loop evalSha across all cluster nodes.Bounce Redis cluster in the middle of the loop.Observe the failures.Observe that restarting the Redisson (bounce microservice in this case) recovers - so the issue is not in Redis cluster.
While putting value into Rmap It throws io.netty.util.IllegalReferenceCountException: refCnt: 0.My application is a spring-boot application. Tried Running on both Tomcat and Undertow embedded server but the result is the same.My SpringBoot version is 2.4.3 but have tried updating it to 2.4.2 and similarly 3.15.3 but the result is the same.Exception Trace=.
Exception in EVALSHA when referring to hash saved using LocalCachedMap.If I use Redisson LocalCachedMap to save into Redis and then refer it using the LocalCachedMap it all works OK.But If i refer to that same object saved using LocalCachedMap in a EVALSHA Lua script i get this exception given below.If i just use RMapCache to save the object and refer it in the same EVALSHA Lua script it works OK - so this means the script has no issue.The issue seems to be when the script has to unpack an object saved using LocalCachedMap.What is the workaround / solution for this ?

Setter detection in Jackson codec ·94 ·.We are using Jackson-based (de)serialization. Our DTOs are immutable and use Lombok's @Jacksonized @Builder (so no setters in those classes).To our surprise, this does not work in all cases. When deserializing with a "pure" Jackson, everything works fine. But when using Redisson, Lombok's @Builder.Default breaks deserialization. In this case, the generated builder class does not have a matching field for the JSON property. For instance, a field String example in the DTO will result in two fields in the builder: String example$value and boolean example$set. None of them matches the JSON property example (serialized from the DTO). However, there is a matching setter method example(String), which is used by Jackson in that case.After a bit of debugging, we found the reason why it works with Jackson directly, but not in Redisson: JsonJacksonCodec explicitly switches off the detection of setters, but only relies on fields (which is obviously not sufficient in this case). The solution is easy: We simply use our own codec that extends JsonJacksonCodec, switch on the setter detection and everything seems to work again.However, the question remains: Why does Redisson explicitly deactivate the detection of setters (and getters, too)? Is there any drawback in allowing it, like we did?
Connection pooling mechanism in redisson.HI Team,I had a doubt regarding redisson connection pooling management.I have an application with a high volume of traffic and hence get a lot of concurrent requests.Have optimised my connection pool accordingly.But i have the following query.What if a new request arrives and all the connections are busy in case of unprecedented volume.How does redisson handle such scenarios.Is there a connection request time out , post which it tries to create a new connection if pool is exhausted OR the request is rejected in absence of a connection in the pool .regards,AC.

No usable error message when failure parsing redisson-jcache.yaml.@edburns was trying to get Open Liberty to persist http session cache data with Redis using redisson-jcache. Something that I (and the Open Liberty team) have not done before. He got the Open Liberty configuration setup correctly, but was getting an exception (see Actual Behaviour section). After much debugging we discovered it was because there was a typo in the yaml meaning there was an exception while parsing it. However the JCachingProvider.loadConfig method is just swallowing all exceptions that occur which means there was no error message anyone could use to determine what went wrong. I managed to track down the problem by inserting a printStackTrace into the IOException catch blocks, but I don't think that would be a PR that the Redisson team would wish to take.Expected behavior.Useful error message like this:
DelayedQueue Durability.Suppose the following scenario:Application Start.BlockingQueue being read.Item added to DelayedQueue to be executed after 30 seconds.Application Restarted, before these 30 seconds.I noticed that, without application restart, the items on the DelayedQueue will be executed correctly. But, if I restart the application after item added to DelayedQueue, but before its scheduled execution, it is not executed.Is this the correct behavior? No durability to itens that are on DelayedQueue?

@RObjectField annotation with codec option has no effect.Expected behavior.According to the brief documentation on the @RObjectField annotation I should be able to use this annotation on a field within a class annotated with @REntity to override the namespace and codec. For instance, in the below demo I'm using @RObjectField to override the serialization mechanism used to encode otherObject.When I apply the @RObjectField annotation I expect the otherObject to be serialized using the JsonJacksonCodec. For instance, after I execute the following code:I should see a Redis command in my MONITOR log that looks like this (note the JSON format):Actual behavior.When I check out the logs of my Redis instance using MONITOR I see the following HSET command.With or without the @RObjectField annotation, the result is always the above. I've also tried different codecs to see if there's a problem with the codec, but I think the annotation is simply being ignored all together. If I move the codec specification to the @REntity annotation, I do see the correct result, but then the entire entity will be serialized using Jackson, which is not what I want.

RLocalCachedMap.containsKey doesn't fire loader.Expected behavior.containsKey looks for a key in local cache, then in redis, and, at last, invokes loader. If loader returns entry, put it in cache and report true.Actual behavior.containsKey doesn't invoke loader at all and returns false for cold local cache/redis.Steps to reproduce or test case.I have a map with loader, however for cold local cache and cold redis, this snipped produces different output.The first one is false if cache + redis is empty, loader is not invoked. The second call invokes loader and populates cache. Subsequent containsKey calls start to work after that.Probably, other Map implementations contains this issue.Single server, LocalCachedMapOptions.defaults() with loader.

Redis Lock - question about edge case.I am looking to use Redis for exclusive locks of resources.If they fail and two workers will think they are holding the lock, that can end up in, let's say, really bad data corruption.I know that a lot of edge cases in Redisson have been covered, however how about this one:Worker1 acquires lock with time of "infinity" (until manual release)Worker1 loses connection to Redis instance, while access to everything else still works and it continues operation on data, databases etc....Lock gets removed from the database, because it expired in 30s (lock watchdog timeout), because of no bump by watchdog.Worker2 has good connection to Redis and is able to acquire the lock and start it's operation on data (leading to corruption)Worker1 gets Redis connection back, it's watchdog tries to recreate the lock in background ASAP, however it lost the race because the lock was already acquired by Worker2.Both Worker1 and Worker2 now think they are holding the lock :(.Looking by the code comments, this seems to be expected behavior/known edge case - one of very few in regards to locks.If I am correct with this scenario, what would you recommend? Going with non-redis solution like etcd or zookeeper, for example?or maybe set the watchdog timeout to a value that will always be more than the execution time of task under that lock and have some custom code for removing failed locks on boot?(so if Worker1 is down I either wait for it come back and automatically clean it's locks that are no longer valid or manually remove the locks owned by Worker1 assuming I want to safely get rid of it)And is there a mechanism to check periodically whether watchdog has lost the race to reacquire the lock and allow application to act on it?

Redisson Rate Limiter -> Hard Limit.The problem I'm seeing is that I'm setting a Rate Limit of lets say 20/second. If there is a period where 20/s is not reached, it will compensate for that and allow a temporary burst of permits over that threshold.I was hoping for a configuration change to set a hard limit for a rate limit -- so that irregardless of the average rate, the rate must never exceed this value.This may be how the rate limiter is already set to function, and i've uncovered a bug, let me know if this is the case and I can attempt to simulate this issue in a test (or at least try).This is how i'm creating my rate limiter:RRateLimiter rl = sharedRedissonClient.getRateLimiter(this::class.simpleName);rl.setRate(RateType.OVERALL, 18L, 1L,  RateIntervalUnit.SECONDS);

Why is `isEvalCacheActive` hardcoded to false inside `CommandBatchService`?Why is isEvalCacheActive hardcoded to false inside CommandBatchService?Due to CommandBatchService being used by RedisBaseLock this means regardless of whether you have useScriptCache set to true in the Redisson config all Redisson locks will be sending the whole script across the network for every lock call.I assume there's a reason for this but is there any way I can use evalsha for locks instead?

Redisson client opens thousands of connections, still disconnected from cluster.Expected behavior.Redisson client should be stable.Actual behavior.Over the weekend we noticed that roughly 50,000 connections were made from Redisson clients or our AWS Elasticache Redis cluster. Typically our Redis cluster has a little over 1000 client connections. This introduced a lot of load on the Redis cluster until requests started timing out. Rebooting applications that use Redis seemed to remediate the issue. There are still some Redisson clients in a broken state.One service is repeatedly logging the following a day later and is in a broken state.I worked with our SRE team and with the use of netstat we discovered that this application was holding 2400 open connections to the Redis cluster! Typically each application will hold around 28 connections.Rebooting the application resolves the issue, which seems to indicate it is a client side issue.I looked back to when the issue started to occur and see no logs about creating new client connections. All I see are Redis operations beginning to timeout.Steps to reproduce or test case.Unclear. We have been running this version of Redisson for months without issue. Typically our services are running for a maximum of 7 days.

`useScriptCache=true` sends whole script to Redis for each lock call when using `RedisBaseLock`.Expected behavior.When useScriptCache = true is in config evalsha should be used for all script executions rather than eval to reduce network load as specified in the docs.Actual behavior.When useScriptCache = true in config eval rather than evalsha gets used for each lock call resulting in significant network load.Steps to reproduce or test case.Open Redis CLI.Execute MONITOR command to see commands executed on Redis.Run redisson.getFairLock('lock-test').tryLock(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); using the configuration below.Note the EVAL from the MONITOR:The reason for this is that CommandBatchService is hardcoded to ignore the config setting:CommandBatchService is used by RedisBaseLock when executing its scripts.

Adding ttl.How do I add the lowest possible TTL to Redisson? Some caches expire after long time. Or would it be better to write clear() on Spring application ready event?This is what the Config looks like:
ClassCastException occurs.I'm seeing these errors in logs, this for Instant and others for Enums as well.My value serializer is StringSerializer and the codec is not defined explicitly so it would be picking by default.What would be the issue? Do I need to change to JDK serializer or Jackson one?
expire(Instant) is not equivalent to expireAt(Date)In #3399, RExpirable#expireAt(Date) is deprecated, and the javadoc said Use expireAt(Instant) instead (in latest release it is called expire(Instant)).But I notice that the implementaions of this two method is not equivalent actually.This breaks some object expiration, such as RedissonBloomFilter.Expected behavior.calling expire(Instant) should expire bloomfilter name and configName both.Actual behavior.only bloomfilter name is expired.Steps to reproduce or test case.expireAt(Date) calls expireAtAsync which is overridden in RedissonBloomFilter which expire name and configName both.

Configure Sentinel on Kubernetes using bitnami/redis.I have a setup of Redis Sentinel on Kubernetes that is using https (single master setup). My configuration looks like follows (Spring Boot):The sentinel instances are running behind one single service redis-cache:26379 in Kubernetes and only that single service must be used to access the sentinel instances.Now I'm constantly seeing the following warnings in the log:Looking at the code in org.redisson.connection.SentinelConnectionManager.SentinelConnectionManager(SentinelServersConfig, Config, UUID) it seems that SENTINEL SENTINELS is executed to get the list of sentinel instances. That won't be correct for the mentioned setup as this returns multiple cluster-internal IPs instead of the single service mentioned above.Is there a possible solution for this (e.g. to disable automatic sentinel discovery)? I saw the configuration option org.redisson.config.SentinelServersConfig.isCheckSentinelsList() but that only disables the check, but not the discovery mechanism.I'm using Redisson 3.15.5.Any ideas how to solve this? Thanks!Also see #2788.
Redisson LOS retry configuration.Hello, I noticed that there's an inbuilt retry mechanism inside Redisson Live Object Service which retries 3 times before throwing the WriteRedisConnectionException exception.Is there anyway, we can further configure this retry logic? Or switch it off in case we want to implement our own?
none.
Connecting to AWS Elasticache cluster using cluster endpoint.Hello,AWS EC exposes 2 ways of connecting to multi-node cluster.It gives us a cluster-endpoint AND it also gives us endpoints for each node.Now, in redisson I see that there's a cluster connection config which requires each of the node endpoint address alongwith replicase i think.And then there's singleServerConfig.I was wondering what's the best way to handle this? If I use single server config with cluster endpoint, will it be okay?Or I always need to use cluster connection config with all node endpoints registered.
MOVED redirection loop detected on AWS Elasticache.Expected behavior.works fine.Actual behavior.Steps to reproduce or test case.It works fine when use cluster config. but the cluster mode has bug when redis failover, like #3635 ,  I want to try replicated mode. and found the issue.
How should users debug subscription timeouts?I often see this error message when my one of my replicated services is trying to acquire a distributed lock from our AWS Elasticache Cluster.Subscribe timeout: (7500ms). Increase 'subscriptionsPerConnection' and/or 'subscriptionConnectionPoolSize' parameters.I followed the suggestion of the message and increased my subscriptionsPerConnection from the default to 500. I still see the error message. I looked at the CPU/Memory usage of the AWS Elasticache cluster and it is below 5%.I have looked into other issues about this topic and I have not found a good way to root cause what is actually going on.Is there a way that we can validate that we are indeed exceeding the subscriptions per connection or are running out of subscription connections?If we are indeed running out of connections is there a way we can dump what subscriptions our connections are using?I have enabled DEBUG level logging and I see the following messages.What is the difference between the freeSubscribeConnectionsAmount and freeSubscribeConnectionsCounter ?
AUTH does not seem to work as expected.Steps:Run this command in redis.acl setuser dummy on allkeys +get +set nopass.Try to do this in redis. This will fail as the user has no permission to do this operation.AUTH dummy password.Run this. This should ideally fail. but it passes!

Redisson complains about multiple masters when two replicated address nodes resolve to the same IP.We are working through issues with using Redisson with AWS Elasticache during upgrade/failover/etc.We currently have a replicated cluster of size 2: 1 master and 1 replicated node.AWS Elasticache provides us with two DNS endpoints to use:During normal operation both of these DNS entries will resolves to different IP addresses, however during upgrade/failover it is possible that only one cluster node is available and the DNS entries will resolve to the same IP addresses.Even when operating the cluster with 1 node I think this should be allowed. This allows infrastructure teams to easily to scale up/down underlying cluster nodes load balanced by DNS without having to modify the application config to include/exclude certain hostnames.Expected behavior.Redisson should tolerate when more than one node address resolves to the same IP address, that happens to be a master in the cluster.Actual behavior.
Redisson Spring Boot Starter is missing CacheManager.Hi,redisson-spring-boot-starter should also expose CacheManager. Currently it does not!!
Redisson Pro.I like redisson so far. Does Redisson open source version support the following?master-slave.cluster.sentinel.if yes, whats the need for pro version?
The ClusterPartition#slotRanges not update in ClusterConnectionManager#checkSlotsMigration.Expected behavior.The  method ClusterConnectionManager#checkSlotsMigration only update the slots, not update the slotRange.

Redisson - remove web dependency. conflicts with WebFlux.Issue:I use Spring WebFlux - reactive web stack. When I added Redisson Spring boot starter - I started seeing weird issues in the application. Then I found that it brings this below unnecessary dependency. I can do maven exclude. But ideally , in redisson, this should be a test scope dependency.spring-boot-starter-web.WebFlux and Web can not be in the same project and it would lead to weird issues.
Stream - do not emit empty map.@mrniko.Issue:Below code returns an empty map when there are no messages. Ideally Mono should be emitting an empty signal. Not an empty map.
Stream API enhancement.Currently redisson stream read does not seem to be really reactive. It just emits via Mono.Can we change the Map<StreamMessageId, Map<>> to a proper data structure?Also stream is never ending data stream.The upstream should listen to downstream demand and emit messages as and when it arrives.
Transaction support for other DS.Currently in transaction mode, we have options for updating only limited data structure.For ex: List is not supported.Is there any reason for this?
Provide Redisson commandExecutor instrumentation.We want to trace command execution with RedissonClient.To approach this with spring I create proxy with cglib and inject it by java reflection API:It would be nice if Redisson will provide some way to set interceptor (or multiple) for command execution (pre- and post-execution). It can be used for several observability purposes like metrics collection or distributed tracing.

Redisson vs Lettuce - Performance Comparison.I was just trying to do a simple performance test to compare Redisson and Lettuce.I really like Redisson. But Redisson seems to be consistently slower than Lettuce. Is this expected?
Azure Redis For Cache. Scheduler stops fire timeouts after redis restart.We're scheduling multiple tasks and using Redisson as a library for distributed scheduling backed by Azure Redis For Cache (cluster mode)Everything works fine during few weeks but at some moment it stops call tasks handlers after timeout. We found that it happens in failover cases (when master is terminated and slave promoted to master or when redis fully rebooted) but not each time. It can be reproduced manually when we randomly restart master/slave redis instances or both of them through Azure Portal. After a few restarts (it happens not each time) our application stops execute tasks handlers when it's time to call it. Newly created tasks for the same instance of RScheduledExecutorService are also not working.If we restart our application when detect this issue, then it handles all scheduled tasks that were not handled after failover and starts working normally.I tried to debug this issue and see that HashedWheelTimer still executing and pushes request Ids through lua script into list (request queue):But entries are never extracted from this list after restart (previously it was done by BLPOP command, but after restart I don't see any BLPOP commands related to this queue and from response queue also: {remote_response}:). Most probably it just doesn't resend BLPOP command after reconnect to Redis and because of this it doesn't call associated handler. Size of queue just increasing when new tasks scheduled:And after restart of an application it immediately handle all of them:Here is a log file that I've captured (with enabled Redisson debug logs) and there you can see that there are no BLPOP commands anymore after restart. I can reproduce the issue but not sure what exactly I should check.Since request queue is a local variable passed to "subscribe" method of RedsissonRemoteService, I cannot check the state of this queue (may be there is a way to do that but didn't found where it can be stored)While debugging after failover, I've tried to call "getBlockingQueue" manually, it returns new instance of blocking queue. Poll/take methods from this newly created queue working fine for this queue after failover. It's possible that re-subcribe didn't happen in some rare situation.Expected behavior.After failover redisson continues fire timouts (calls handlers)Actual behavior.Redisson stops call scheduler tasks handlers. Even newly scheduled tasks are not working.Redis version.Azure Redis for Cache (Redis 4.0.14)
Quarkus native remote service invocation fails.I tried to call a simple remote redisson service, compiled to quarkus native, but the invocations fails, because of a ClassNotFoundException org.redisson.remote.RemoteServiceRequest.This class seems not to be registered for reflection and serialization. If trying to add it manually with graal-options, other CNFExceptions occure, because other redisson classes are missing. Not native-compiled invocations of such a service work well.Quarkus version: 2.0.0.Final.Expected behavior.The invocation of a remote service works.Actual behavior.The invocation fails with a ClassNotFoundException.
Allow to set task id for RScheduledExecutorService.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.Currently, there is no "native" way to determine if task is already submitted to Executor in distributed environment, across several Application instances.It's true when some of the instances restarts and the instance doesn't have any correlation between generated task id (random in current implementation) and actual task.The new feature will allow to avoid submitting duplicate tasks.Describe the solution you'd like.Describe alternatives you've considered.I used some sort of workaround and maintain separated HSET to hold actual submitted task, such that application instance calculates the ID from actual task on startup and verify that task already exists in HSET.This approach is a kind of shame in our codebase, since it requires instances to have distributed lock for task verifying and registration process. It is something like leader election based on lock.P.s. my thought that this is a crucial part in the library, since it will allow to seamlessly implement "distributed task queue" and get off unmaintained quartz solutions without extra hassles that i had to implement.

org.redisson.client.RedisException: Unexpected exception while processing command.I am using Radisson as a distributed cache and it is updating by two aws ECS instances. Eventually, I am getting this exception. when clear the cache it is working fine properly and again it is happening after some time. I could not narrow down the problem. looking for help from here.Cache objects are updating frequently by java services and frequently retrieving.Issue happens eventually, which means that some objects are caching and retrieving properly and sometimes retrieving getting this error.Note: by searching on the web, I have found that there was a marshalling issue and redisson has fixed it on 3.15.x versions. Even after I update the library, this issue existing.

Kotlin objects with JsonJacksonCodec.Hi!!I'm using Redis as a cache provider with the help of Redisson in a kotlin service.At first I tried to set in redis non Serializable objects and I had to change to a JsonJacksonCodec in order to encode non Serializable objects. However some code at initTypeInclusion from JsonJacksonCode.java is avoiding our jackson to write @Class property for kotlin classes (they are closed by default).I have created a custom Codec in kotlin extending JsonJacksonCodec:And everything works! Now I can serialize and deserialize kotlin classes into Json and keep them in redis.However I'm wondering, as we are passing class type to getBucket:redisProvider.getClient()?.getBucket<V>(cacheKeyToString(namespace, key))?.get()?.awaitSingleOrNull()Can't we just use that information to indicate Jackson which class should be used to deserialize???Also, did you find OK my JsonJacksonKotlinCodec?

Redisson - JDK 16.Hello, while doing communication using redisson I encountered a problem because on JDK 16 when deserializing a packet redisson cannot find the class (ClassNotFoundException). (The same code works fine on version 8 and on version 11 (with the same version of redisson)). That is why I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong or redisson doesn´t support JDK version 16.Stacktrace.Of course this class exists, there is a screenshot of that.
ByteBuf leak when RedissonScoredSortedSet addAll.Expected behavior.No memory leak.Actual behavior.Apparently there is a direct memory leak problem when using Redisson and RedissonScoredSortedSet.We noticed more and more memory being used by our container when started using our service in particular way, storing larger amount of objects than usual, but we couldn't see it in the heap dump.After enabling paranoid leak detection in netty we got the exceptions:	org.redisson.RedissonScoredSortedSet.addAll(RedissonScoredSortedSet.java:364)	our.service.RedisClient.set(RedisClient.java:34)We are pushing larger set to the cache, about 3000-4000 objects few KB each.It keeps increasing everytime the data expires (our case 5 minutes) so most certainly set.addAll is causing that. After a couple hours the container hits the limit, but heap stays the same.Steps to reproduce or test case.Our code is rather simple:

RMapCache.hi,We use RMapCache object to save our data, but we can see that the redisson client gets all the map when we need data and not a specific key on the map.is there a better way or map to prevent this behaviour and get the key we want instead of all the map and continue having TTL leave map ?
ReactiveRedissonTransactionManager`s transactionOption change, but not work.Expected behavior.transactionOptions timeout option disable.Actual behavior.transactionOptions timeout option not disable.Steps to reproduce or test case.Hello.I use redisson with spring framework.create ReactiveRedissonTransactionManager bean.I set the timeout to -1 but it didn't set as desired.

Dynamic cache name when using with spring boot.I'm using Spring Cache as the abstract level for caching and Redisson as the client. Everything works fine, but recently I had a an issue with high cpu and memory when handle a lot of requests. Now i'm searching how to optimize or solve it. I read https and see that Redis hash data type works well only when there is small number of entries in a hash.This is how I'm using Redisson with Spring Cache.And I use spring Cacheable annotation in my method with the value as "CacheA" or "CacheB".I checked the source code of RedissonSpringCacheManager, Redisson create a RMapCache instance for every cache names which are mapped to corresponding hash key in Redis. In my example there is two RMapCache instances, one for "CacheA", and one for "CacheB".Now come to my issue, because my cache object (ex: CacheA) has thousands of entries. My idea is to split it into smaller hashes by altering the cache name dynamically. Example: CacheA-1, CacheA-2,....But how can I do that in Redisson? Bellow is the code of createMapCache method in RedissonSpringCacheManager.java.Thanks,
Can't parse json config /tomcat/redisson.conf.I experienced "The session manager failed to start due to previous errors".

Redisson connections release while command execution attempt failed.We faced an issue in following Azure Redis Cluster configuration:And we have a question:When RedisExecutor executes its command and retryTimeout happened then:1.1. Error message is assigning to exception variable.1.2. Then attemptPromise is cancelling.1.3. Then attemptPromise.onComplete happens which calls releaseConnection.1.4. There is a code.which do not release connection if connectionFuture.isSuccess() == false (and this condition always met in case of timeout or I am wrong?).And looks like that its never releases this connection and free connection counter semaphore is not releasing at all here.Is it expected behavior? Should we always have connectTimeout less than retryInterval?And in case when 2nd attempt fails too, we still see in the logs "after 0 retry attempts" because we already have "exception" variable set on previous step.
Predicate filter on RListReactive list returns non-deterministic result.Expected behavior.Actual behavior.Returned array is non-deterministic way. Values that it can take:Steps to reproduce or test case.I use Redisson RedissonReactiveClient with Spring Boot 2.5.2. I wrote the following example code. When I hit refresh in the browser, I receive different array sizes in a non-deterministic way. The array is always deleted before the execution, so array should always contain the following 4 elements and filtering by "B" should return the two elements of the array, where the result  of the applied predicate is true.Redis runs dockerized on localhost.

Issue with AWS Elasticache using ReplicatedConfig when failover.Hello,We are working through issues using Redisson with AWS Elasticache during switch between master/slave.We currently have a replicated cluster of size 2: 1 master and 1 replicated node. AWS Elasticache provides two DNS endpoint: the primary one, and the reader.Sometime on a failover, there is a switch between the master and the slave behind the DNS and redisson update his connexion. But it seem that the Redisson switch is incorrect and our service can't proceed command when this occurs.Here is some log to help:Jul 18, 2021 @ 08:57:42.757 ERROR redisson-netty-2-1 Can't process the remote service request.

Batch check the existence of keys in RedissonMap.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.I am using RedissonMap to store ... a map! Sometimes I wish to check if a key is present in the map without having to actually get the value. Redis provides a command HEXISTS to do this, and I can see that in RedissonMap we leverage this command to implement containsKey efficiently.However, sometimes I would like to check the presence of multiple keys in the map, sometimes many thousands. The naive solution to simple call containsKey ends up round-tripping to redis many times.Describe the solution you'd like.I would like a batch method (maybe something like containsKeys) which indicates the presence or absence of many keys at once, without round-tripping to redis many times.Describe alternatives you've considered.I can call getAll() and just look at which keys got returned, however this returns all the values as well, which I don't care about in my case and which consume additional network + memory resources.I could bypass RedissonMap and simply issue a pipelined request for many HEXISTS, but this is extra complexity I have to handle myself and it bypasses the RMap abstraction.
Question about Redisson pub/sub listeners not re-subscribing after Redis maintenance.Hi,I'm fairly new to Redis/Redisson and have a question about an issue that I have encountered during Redis maintenance (planned switchover I think).My application is running on Azure against Azure Cache for Redis.The application is using Redisson pub/sub listeners but after Redis maintenance only 1 of many listeners re-subscribed and other listeners fail to deliver new messages that are being published.I'm not sure if I should increase some retries-related configuration to avoid this problem or is more in-depth investigation (including redisson logs) required.Example of successful re-subscription:I would appreciate any help with this issue.

RedissonClient.getList() performance.Hi,RedissonClient.getList() currently is doing a count on the list and retrieving every item one by one. We have a dynamic list that increases with time so the response time of the app also increases linearly with as the time to fetch more of the list items get longer.From AWS xray tracing:We have 267 items in the list and the above repeats for all items in the list:If there a way to get all list items in redisson with LRANGE instead?
Class cast exceptions on CommandsData.We're using redisson pro and getting class cast exceptions. Our dependencies in maven look like:The exceptions we're getting:Does someone have an idea how to resolve this?
Command still hasn't been written into connection!We are experiencing what at first glance seems like network related errors using the latest version of redisson pro. However we noticed that this error only occurs on LPOP commands.Increasing netty threads has no effect on this, also increasing timeout config did not improve the errors.Also when deploying our code (on a test environment without load) we see a heavy increase in cpu usage on redis master nodes. The load increases by 50% and drops very slowly in about 1 hour to <5%.We are using the RedissonClusteredSpringLocalCachedCacheManager (but the same occurs when using RedissonClusteredSpringCacheManager)
not consistent response.We have 2 application servers (Tomcats) and our application is not sticky which mean that every request can reach different application server.In our flow we upload data from one server to Redis and then read data from the second server but don't get the uploaded data.Can the reason for this behavior can be related to local cache implementation in Redisson? Can we disable it per put request or only disable it for all Redisson client requests?we use to get the data.
Regression - quarkus native builds fail after updating netty in 3.16.1.After upgrading to redisson 3.16.1 there are build failures of native quarkus, the stracktrace points to netty. as far as i can see there was a minor version upgrade of netty in the last release, so maybe this is the reason, in 3.16.0 everything works fine.Quarkus Version: 2.0.3 Final.
sslProtocols parse issue.Hi.After adding sslProtocols option to redisson.yaml file I get error below:redisson version: 3.16.1 for tomcat 8.After removing sslProtocols line no errors reported in tomcat console.
RedisTimeoutException following RedisLoadingException.In our setup, we have sharded mode cluster consisting of 6 shares, 2 nodes per shard.Our redisson client interacts with only the MASTER node in each shard.Recently we experienced the following exception: "org.redisson.client.RedisLoadingException: LOADING Redis is loading the dataset in memory". Following that exception, we had been getting RedisTimeoutException on majority of the calls until we finally restarted our application services and the problems went away.Any clue as to what might be the cause of this? I am suspecting this is a problem with the redisson client itself.

Redisson throwing java.io.NotSerializableException when trying to publish something in a topic.I'm really confused as to why I got this error, and I might have misunderstood how topics work with objects in Java.So basically when doing RedissonClient#getTopic(nameOfTheTopic).publish(objectToPublish), I'm getting this NotSerializableException.The object I'm trying to send is this class:Can't you send classes other than the ones from the JRE or am I missing something that I need to do in order to be able to do so?

Redis Stream Support For Spring Applications.@mrniko.This is a feature request.Currently Spring supports only Kafka and RabbitMQ for cloud stream applications. There is no support for Redis Stream.I think Redisson could implement this interface and provide redis binder via redisson.
RedissonMapCache#addListener with Redis Sentinel may cause NOPERM exception.RedissonMapCache#addListener is trying to detect OS type by executing INFO command, which is considered dangerous by Redis (part of its dangerous ACL list).This causes exception:NOPERM this user has no permissions to run the 'info' command or its subcommand.As a workaround, user can be granted an access to this command.But, there should be a way to avoid INFO command at all (for example, by allowing to specify RedissonMapCache#osType explicitly along with adding something like BaseEventCodec.OSType#NONE).
Issue when testing failover on AWS Elaticache.Hi, I'm facing an issue when testing failover on AWS Elaticache.I'm using Redis Cluster with 2 slots, each slot contains 1 master and 1 slave.It takes about 8 minutes after I trigger a failover event and the Redis works well but my services seem cannot recover by themselves.I dump a thread capture and may get some useful information:I'm using jetty as our web container and the operation I'm using with Redisson is quite simple - this.redissonClient.getBucket()The reason why the service cannot recover is that threads are blocked in JVM, I can see 900 qtp* in JVM and their states look like this:From my understanding, when the web requests try to get data from Redis Cluster, one of the nodes takes the task asynchronously then callback to the service by Netty epoll. So when the master failover, the tasks on this node cannot answer anymore, which makes those qtp* threads cannot finish.I'm wondering if my guess is correct and how I can solve this issue, like giving a timeout for web requests or returning exceptions from Redisson side?Although failover is not a common case, it still hurts a lot when my service cannot recover automatically.Expecting for your response, thanks a lot.
Redisson No Session in spring app on tomcat.I have integrated redisson in tomcat as specified in doc. My application is built in spring framework and running on tomcat server 8.5.

Does near cache options also apply to the backing RMap?I can set max size, eviction algorithm etc. using LocalCachedMapOptions, but it's unclear from the documentation if those options also apply to the backing RMap. Given that RLocalCachedMap does not subclass RMapCache, I'm guessing no, but would like to hear from a maintainer.You can use this ticket for improving the documentation in this respect.
Redis operations metrics.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.I'd like to see metrics for low level Redis operations, like GET, SET etc.Describe the solution you'd like.Expose metrics around these operations. The only available metrics is for RedissonCache, and there is no visibility into any of the other data structures.As a less desirable solution, you may consider providing interceptors for a client to implement and export their own metrics.Describe alternatives you've considered.None.
RedissonReactiveClient limitations.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.RedissonReactiveClient is missing many of the features compared to  RedissonClient.Returned RMapReactive has no methods to set max size or eviction algorithm.No method to create a LocalCachedMap (or perhaps) LocalCachedMapReactive. There's an open issue #3671 for this point only.Describe the solution you'd like.Bring feature parity between blocking and reactive API.Describe alternatives you've considered.Using blocking API.
Flushing write-behind tasks.So i have set up redis as read-through/write-behind cache for a mongoDB. Now there is data i want to persist when the application stops.Writing into the cache isnt enough as the MapWriter that writes from redis into mongodb is run by the same application.If i stop the application and write my data into the cache then my MapWriter wants to wait some seconds to batch write the data from cache into db.But at this time the application is already stopped and nothing will be persisted.Is there some way to flush the write-behind tasks in a blocking fashion?

Topic listener removal · 77 ·.Is it necessary to explicitly remove a Topic listener before shutdown, or does shutdown remove it anyway?
Listeners unregistered · 78 ·.Hey.Not sure if this is an issue. I'm using a topic to transit data between two instances. Sometimes, listeners are unregistered randomly, and I don't know why, server is just publishing data, it works 1-5 times and then it breaks :/.Config:Monitor (first wave it works, second doesn't) :Thanks for your help, if you need more details, tell me!

Post slave-recovery , GetType commands continue to being sent to master node instead of slave nodes.Expected behavior.Master redis node should never get GetType commands.Actual behavior.After unexpected traffic-load (spike) on redis, redisson starts sending gettype commands to master nodes instead of slave nodes.Steps to reproduce or test case.On sudden spikes , this issue has been observed , its random in nature. Issue goes away after service restart.(Also , happens very frequently.)Both client service accessing the redis cluster and the redis cluster are in the same VPC.Redis cluster : AWS Elastic Cache is used. Cluster is 3 shards with 6 nodes  with each shard containing one master and one replica node.

Deserialization difference between RedissonMap and RedissonLocalCachedMap.Expected behavior.I was writing some unit tests and I discovered that I could not perform any operations on a second instance of RedissonLocalCachedMap when I was storing non primitive key/values in the map.My expectation is that a second instance of RedissonLocalCachedMap would be able to read values from a map as long as RedissonMap could. This is preventing me from using RedissonLocalCachedMap in my code.Actual behavior.
exception class loader.hi,we have the following exception even we change the configuration to :
Why does redisson always reconnect the old redis pod ip?Our redis cluster is composed of three nodes, and each node is loaded with two redis pods. Two redis pods die when a single node goes down. But redisson always tries to connect these dead redis pods.When a single node goes down:When the redis cluster returns to normal.
redisson currently does not fully support the redis lpush command.Currently, the "lpush" command of redis >= 2.4 supports multiple elements at a time, while the corresponding "RDeque.addFirst()" in redisson only supports one element.Similar commands that are not fully supported include "rpush", "sadd", "srem".Hope these features are supported, thanks.

RMap.loadAll() probably should clear unexistent entries.Hello,I've got rather confusing experience with loadAll() method. I used it on startup to 'sync' redisson map with database, however, it doesn't clean values not existed in database.I can use.but it is not atomic and I've found no functions to lock entire map access while I do this.As loadAll() calls loadAllKeys(), maybe it better to clean nonexistent keys at the end of loading if loadAllKeys = true?Reproduction snipped to illustrate:

Redis Stream XTRIM with MINID strategy is not fully supported: incompatible parameter type.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.The API to trim a redis stream (see the correspoding XTRIM command) supports different strategies via the org.redisson.api.stream.TrimStrategy type.Yet the additional command parameters in the overloaded methods (e.g. trim, trimAsync, trimNonStrictAsync) will allow only ints.Specifically you can now only pass a.int threshold (to say how many messages you want to keep)int limit (to remove up to a given number of messages)Those are inconsistent with the TrimStrategy.MINID which expects a message Id as input.Since the message Ids are composed of a timestamp in millis from epoch and a number, the current int param won't be able to technically be used for such a job, even ignoring the semantics of the param.An int is not enough to encode a valid millis timestamp which is part of the message Id.Describe the solution you'd like.It would be nice to provide overloaded methods taking an instance of org.redisson.api.StreamMessageId, and - most importantly- a simple String, to allow partial matches.Describe alternatives you've considered.I will probably use a work-around by calling the low-level redis client, but the issue is mostly about the current API which is a bit misleading in what it provides.
RRateLimiter drift.Rate limit decreases over the time in highly concurrent environment.Demo of such drift is on screenshot. Rate there has been limited by only RRateLimiter.Expected behavior.Limit should not change without explicit call of setRate() with new value.Actual behavior.Limit changes over hours. As a workaround I explicitly call setRate() with the same values time to time.Steps to reproduce or test case.Just regular usage, nothing special:
Redis hostnames support for Sentinel mode.
port out of range:-1 if host is starting with slash.Description.If hostname is given to Config with leading slash it causes exception 'port out of range:-1'.Expected behavior.Either of two variants:exception about incorrect host should be thrown.slash should be trimmed silently from host string and proceed.Actual behavior.This behaviour is very misleading and cause to search a ghost mistake with port configuration instead of host typo.Steps to reproduce or test case.

RExecutorService execute same task twice at the same time ·.I submit 200 tasks into RExecutorService and get 202 tasks executed.The log shows the task :  00e3b0a299b6e8e71dc887aa9e728f4ac8 push into.I guess it may cause by retry mechanism, because the client connect to REDIS via VPN and the network is slow and unstable.the result : task 00e3b0a299b6e8e71dc887aa9e728f4ac8 executed twice.attachment is the log store in json format.
why send may command when use mget command and all keys in same slot?when i use getBuckets().get("{test}abcd", "{test}bcdf", "{test}efgc");i trace the code and find the 3 key use hash tags, so their have the same hash code(by connectionManager.calcSlot)but in executeBatchedAsync, cretae 3 command (mget {test}abcd, mget {test}bcdf, mget {test}efgc ) and run in CommandBatchService.why? and i think send a command (mget {test}abcd, {test}bcdf, {test}efgc) is better than now?
RExecutorService sometime will stuck and does not resume task anymore.I am tring to use RExecutorService in my project.The test env connect to redis via VPN and the network is slow and unstable.In my test. sometimes the RExecutorService will stuck and does NOT resume task anymore.The RExecutorService is named : "redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc".The RExecutorService will store request in : {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}.and store task into {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:tasks.I found the {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService} is empty but the task in {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:tasks does not processed and remain in {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:tasks.relative data store in redis:Expected behavior.Task submit into RExecutorService being executed.Actual behavior.The RExecutorService being stick and task remain in {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:tasks .Steps to reproduce or test case.Start my application.after started , waiting for 5 minutes.submit task into RExecutorService.the task does NOT executed and remain in {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:tasks.{redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService} is empty.value store in {redisson-web-online-test-DistSvc:org.redisson.executor.RemoteExecutorService}:counter is 1.
Curious to ask, why deprecate the json configuration ?When I used org.redisson.config.Config#fromJSON(java.lang.String) to generate Config, I found that this method has been deprecated.When using redisson-spring-boot-starter, the value of spring.redis.redisson.config is String. I think json String is less prone to format errors than yaml String.

Hostname ends up comparing against IP address.Expected behavior.When using redis and sentinel in hostname mode, when redis and sentinel instances are restarted, the redisson client should allow its known slaves to reconnect to the same master.Actual behavior.Redisson is comparing the hostname to a saved IP address and not realized it is the same.Steps to reproduce or test case.Redis deployed into K8s using the following settings:Setup:3 redis + 3 sentinel (running in a Kubernetes cluster), kill off 2 pairs of redis/sentinels pods (redis master and a replica)the pods come back with different IP address sometimes (but not always) and they a.Redis returns to a healthy state, but running into issues where the client can't recover.One issue is that replicas coming back are not being considered having the same master.We can see here that the SentinelConnectionManager thinks current master is 100.64.110.145 while the replica is reporting its master as redis-node-1's hostname.they both point to the same instance, but the comparison is not working correctly.I'm not sure yet if its caused by the same comparison issue, when killing and recreating the pod which was running the master redis node, we are running into a state where the ClientConnectionsEntry for MASTER is marked as frozen, even after it should have been working. I think it may be a timing issue with the unfreeze call during re-connection, but still working on isolating it. (if i manually unfreeze the master entry via remote debugging, it starts to work again)
Lambda task not work as expect in RExecutorService.I submit Lambda task into RExecutorService but get strange executing result.below is my code:
bitfield xx get i8 :READONLY You can't write against a read only slave.use client.getBitSet("bitsettest").getByte(1)it will send "bitfield bitsettest get i8 1" to slave node.but redis return a error -READONLY You can't write against a read only slave.so bitfield xx get ...  command only work on master node?so we need use "commandExecutor.writeAsync" to execute command?
[question] 3 node SENTINEL init fails with "SENTINEL SENTINELS command returns less than 2 nodes".SENTINEL SENTINELS command returns less than 2 nodes! At least two sentinels should be defined in Redis configuration. Set checkSentinelsList = false to avoid this check.Any idea why this could happen.note:redisson version 3.15.0.
Question about use of Redisson againt Azure Cache for Redis.We use Azure Cache for Redis.We configure Redisson as follows:clusterServersConfig:nodeAddresses:In our application log we see Redisson querying cluster nodes details and obtaining info about two specific instances (Master and Replica; ports 15000 and 15001)We're observing issues when there's a scheduled maintenance on Redis instances (github issue 3739).Microsoft support came back to us with following feedback: your application is directly connecting to the port 15001 which means it is connecting to specific instance. Please note that it is not a good practice to connect to the specific instance as during patching, if it goes down for an update, you start seeing errors. I would suggest you to connect to Redis over port 6380.Is it possible to make Redisson follow this recommendation i.e. always connect to port 6380 and not to specific instances?
Question about ConnectionListener with AWS ElastiCache for Redis.Hello,We have multiple instances of an application running in AWS ECS.We periodically encounter a scenario where one (not all) container's RedissonClient with ConnectionListener receives onDisconnect calls from previously connected Redis hosts that never connects again. Other containers remain connected to the same hosts and are able to operate as expected.Hoping for assistance to understand a way to avoid this scenario.When we run against a docker cluster on our local computers, we are able to restart Redis instances at will and see disconnects and reconnects as we expect. Only in AWS do we find permanent disconnects. Eventually, our RedissonClient is disconnected from Redis completely and cannot make any progress on its work.Thank you for any help.Our RedissonClient is created more or less like so:
RedissonV3.16.2 write null command to slave node when use epoll transportMode.You can't try to checkFuture by write command to redis, the slave node in redis cluster shouldn't be allowed to do this.
Unable to send PING during load test.While running a load test, I'm occasionally seeing these "Unable to send PING command" errors. Wondering if there's a particular timeout setting I can use to try to overcome these. Separately, trying to understand if this could be related to spurious disconnects seen by a configured ConnectionListener. In a previous question, I asked about any experience/advice regarding how to manage cases where a RedissonClient loses connections that are never re-established. If a RedissonClient has disconnected from a cluster, what is the best way to heal it and re-establish connections to the cluster?
none.
Multiple connection pools created to failover slave while redis server rebooted.Expected behavior.When a master/slave fails over, the appropriate connection pool should only reconnect once and no. of connections on redis server should be 2X at max.Actual behavior.Seeing multiple connection pools being initialised and repeatedly a pub sub connection being initialised, making failover redis node unresponsive due to connection exhaustion.Logs from a single application server, initialising slave pool 20 times, in less than 4 seconds.Steps to reproduce or test case.Not sure, as it was an unexpected outage of redis server. But you can try failing multiple redis nodes at once.
Pub Sub connections being initialised repeatedly after redis server VM became unresponsive.Expected behavior.If a redis server goes down, maximum of 2x connections should be seen on the failover node, with no change needed in pub sub connections.Actual behavior.We are seeing much more connections than 2x (Reaching 50k connected clients in this case) and pub sub connections being initialised repeatedly to the nodes on the unreachable server.Does redisson require pub sub pool for any internal functions or can the pool size be set to 0, effectively disabling it?Steps to reproduce or test case.1 VM was running 3/18 cluster nodes in the redis cluster.  It became unresponsive and we saw a surge in connections to that VM after that.
Inconsistent Performance Retrieving Data From Redis with Redisson.We have Redis setup in as a Master with 2 Slaves.  Generally it works well.  Occasionally when we pull a large cached object from Redis, the time to pull the data from the cache is 50-60 seconds.  The good times we have seen are 3-6 seconds to pull the same data.  Is their anything we can do to make it more consistent (obviously we want it to be in the 3-6 seconds range).  The data is stored in an RList.  This particular case the data is very large, 16-17MB.  This is an unusual case, but we need to be faster nonetheless.I have run the latency checks on the server, no issues there.I will add that we are constantly adding new items to the cache.  These items expire after 60 minutes (ttl).  The cache typically has about 1600 items in it at any given time (during peak usage hours).  Redis is running inside a Kubernetes environment, as is the client application (same K8S environment).  Memory usage for the 3 Redis instances is hovering around 70-80MB we have allocated 2G for each (max).Is there anything you can think of that would cause a request for cached item to suddenly take 50-60 seconds?
I expect to receive a delayed message without pushing a new or null data to the delay queue.Expected behavior.1 Write the data to the redisson delay queue and set delay time is 30s.2 Shutdown the consumer application within 30s and starts again.3 Start consumer application before or after 30s.4 I expect to receive a delayed message.Actual behavior.1 The consumer application is no longer received until the delay queue's data is delay.2 Write a new data to the redisson delay queue , the consumer side can receive historically unspent and newly written data.Steps to reproduce or test case.STEP 1 Offer data to the delay queue, set delay 30s.delayQueueService.addDelayQueue("HELLO", 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS, "TEST");STEP 2 Shutdown consumer application.STEP 3 Start consumer application.the delay data can not be recevied, Expected recevied the delay data.STEP 4 Offer data to delay queue again,but do not shutdown consumer application.delayQueueService.addDelayQueue("HELLO AGAIN", 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS, "TEST");STEP 5 The consumer application received the message "HELLO" immediately, and 30s later , the message "HELLO AGAIN" can be received.I expect to receive a delayed message without pushing a new or null data to the delay queue.Redis version.6.2.4.

How does spring boot1.5x upgrade the redisson version from 3.8.x to 3.11.x?From the dependency of redisson 3.11.3 version, we can see that the spring boot used is 2x, and now our project uses spring boot 1.5.9, how should I upgrade to redisson 3.11.3 version? The following is a screenshot of the error report.The reason for the upgrade is to fix the bugs of versions before 3.9.1.#1811.
Stream - DS.Let's imagine a stream created like this.I thought I should be able to add a list of payment events into the stream. But looks like I need to always convert it into a map to add it to the stream.My point is - each stream entry is for 1 event. Not for collection of events.I have to add it like this.If we see, the key is basically unnecessary here.Can you please explain the reason behind the such data structure? Is it because redis's limitation? Or do we have any other better use case?

redisson-hibernate fails to load config when running in Quarkus dev mode.I had to do a bit of a workaround to pick the Redisson Hibernate 2LC instead of the official Quarkus 2LC:Notice how I've also had to override createRedissonClient(). This was due to the config file not being found when running in Quarkus Dev Mode.See Quarkus#2531. They suggest using currentThread() to get the correct classloader.

How to get notified of an expired lock lease?Hello. Wondering how to be notified of a lock's expired lease?I've tried adding an ExpiredObjectListener and a DeletedObjectListener to my lock, but neither of those received an event when my lock's lease expired.I do see that I can call lock.remainTimeToLive, but wonder if there's a way to configure a listener for that.Thanks for any suggestions.
How to add custom tags to Redisson metrics.Hi,We usually add custom tags, like "environment", to our Spring Boot apps the way recommended by Spring Boot docs:So that all metrics exported to our InfluxDB contains this tag.We moved to Redisson recently, with a PRO license, and configured the metrics export with Influx as pointed in docs this way:We can correctly see metrics in our InfluxDB but the environment custom tag is missing.Also tried this with no luck:How can we do this?Thanks.

How does PING influences the BATCH command?I'm doing a batch command in the following way:From time to time we get the following Timeout exception:org.redisson.client.RedisResponseTimeoutException: Redis server response timeout (20 ms) occured after 0 retry attempts. Increase nettyThreads and/or timeout settings. Try to define pingConnectionInterval setting. Command: null, params: null.I'm wondering about the Try to define pingConnectionInterval setting. in the WARN message. We use the default setting for PING (the 30s interval). What is the meaning of that sentence in the message? Is the PING necessary? Could we disable the PING?  How does the PING influences the batch command? Any suggestions how this WARN can be avoided?
Quarkus extension seems to only use config from build time.Weve had to revert to using reddison and creating the client ourselves as it seems only config used at build time is injected into the client, which is then causing issues for the native build. Looking here it seems this may be the case. Is this to be expected, or am i missing something here. we need this to read from an external yaml file thats managed in kubernetes.
RTransaction::getBucket returns different instances on subsequent calls to the same transaction.Hi.We create datastructures from RTransaction so that we can see uncomitted changes.While this works on the same instance of the datastructure, it does not when the same thread retrieves it again from the same instance of the RTransaction.As the RTransaction is the isolating bit, we were wondering, if the same RTransaction should return the same instance of the datastructure on subsequent calls.This seems to be true with all datastructures (Bucket, Map, ...)quick test:

Unable to register multiple Reference codecs in RedissonClient.In Redisson 3.15.2, getReferenceCodecProvider() was removed from RedissonObjectBuilder.java.This breaks code that adds a reference codec with the RedissonObjectBuilder, for example:RedissonObjectBuilder now only allows registration of the single codec set on the Redisson Config object.Is there an alternative way to add another reference codec?  We need to use JsonJacksonCodec by default for references, but have a sub class that needs to use TypedJsonJacksonCodec.

Connection Leak.(Maybe related to #3840)Expected behavior.Following fresh startup of service utilizing Redisson client, AWS ElastiCache nodes each maintain consistent ~1k active connections from our service without change (with exception of node failovers, re-sharding, etc)Actual behavior.Slow connection leak after deployment of 3.16.3 client & constant spam of new connections being created. Previous client versions (tested all of 3.15.6, 3.16.0, 3.16.1, 3.16.2) have maintained constant ~1k connections per node without new connection spam.Pattern of connection leak is unclear - connections increased continuously for ~11 hours, slowly decreased over another ~10 hours. Starting experiencing complete cache failure a bit before lowest peak of active connections during leak was hit.AWS ElastiCache metrics:(First drop is from trying re-deployment, where connection leak occurred again)Sample of debug-level logs (sanitized): https.Reverting to previous client version resolves issue.Steps to reproduce or test case.We have been able to repeat this issue across service deployments, but can't give general reproduction steps.
Reddison 3.16.3 is using netty-common 4.1.68.Final and netty-handler 4.1.68.Final but when I upgrade latest version of reddison is still using netty 4.1.66 version.Hi Everyone!I am using in my pom.xml the latest version of reddison - 3.16.3 which is supposed to use the latest versions of netty-handler and netty-codec, but when I run mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=io.netty:netty-codec and mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=io.netty:netty-handler I see it is using 4.1.66 version instead of 4.1.68 version.Can we take a look at this please?Thank you.

Try to increase 'nettyThreads' and/or connection pool size settingsNode source.Expected behavior.When the Redis network has  restored, applications send  requests to redis cluster operation,redisson operation to All master  are  OK  after master/slave switch.Actual behavior.When the Redis network has  restored, applications send  requests to redis cluster operation,redisson operation to these old master is normal, but redisson operation to   another new master is  exception occurs after master/slave switch.What causes this?The whole network failure of redis cluster was simulated and the production problem was restored.[ Step one ].View the current cluster status,result  is healthy.[ Step two ].Shut down the Redis network and check the application log:The ClusterConnectionManager detects a network exception and fails to connect to the host every 5s.[ Step three ].Restore the Redis network and check the application log.The ClusterConnectionManager detects the cluster node status.An master/slave switch occurs on 7001 and 7005, and the cluster status is abnormal.The Redis cluster status check is cancelled.[ Step Four ].Send a request to check the status of redis operation. The result is as follows:Redisson  operated  7003 7002 is normal, and operated  7001 exception of  master/slave switch occured.

How does "RedisTimeoutException: Unable to get connection! Try to increase 'nettyThreads' and/or connection pool size settingsNode source" happe.the 6 nodes cluster is composed of 7005,7002,7004 that are master nodes,and 7001,7003,7006 that are replica nodes.When Node 7001 replicas 7005 and 7005 fails, the cluster promote node 7001 as the new master and continue to operate.After Node 7005 is replica node and Node 7001 is master node, the redisson client write to Node 7001 and replies RedisTimeoutException.
IndexOutOfBoundsException on reading PENDING Array[Byte] message.Expected behavior.Possibly a null for a message value could be returned instead of an exception.Actual behavior.An exception is thrown.Steps to reproduce or test case.I had a steam consumer that had both new and PENDING messages.Then I cleaned up my stream from the old messages using XTRIM my-stream MINID 1633844273000-0 command. All the events up to this point have been removed.It happened that some of the PENDING messages were also removed by XTRIM command. Still, they are present in PENDING list of my consumer, but the values of the messages are nil.When I try to look for data for one of those nil events (1632735948072-0), I do not find them, but Redis is providing me newer message:I understand this looks like Redis bug and PENDING should not reference the message that no longer exists.But I think Redisson could handle better this case and return at least null as a message value instead of throwing an exception. The reason is, I am reading 10 messages and only 1 of them can be problematic, while now the whole XREADGROUP command blows, and I am unable to handle that problematic message programmatically, e.g. acknowledge this message as having wrong message value.

Low ScanInterval burns CPU.Hello.We tried to scale cluster under the load, but we got a lot of Node hasn't been discovered yet exceptions. To prevent them we changed scanInterval to 25ms. It helped, but according to JFR 30+% of CPU is burned to refresh cluster state:For me it seems that ClusterConnectionManager.checkMasterNodesChange has a O(n^2) complexity and can be simplified to O(n) using map instead of inner loop.Are there any recommendations what values should scanInterval have? And how can we update it on the fly to scale cluster?

Regression in 3.16.3 fails EVALSHA operation on multiple-shard Redis Cluster with authenticated connections.Redisson version 3.16.3 EVALSHA no longer works with AWS ElastiCache Redis Cluster that has more than 1 shard when the Redisson client is configured to use Redis authentication and TLS connections.Downgrading to Redisson version 3.12.5 fixes this issue, and operations with multiple shard clusters with authentication work as expected.Expected behavior.EVALSHA operation on multi-shard cluster completes successfully when connection is using Redis authentication.Actual behavior.The following code works on multi-shard clusters when clsuter Redis authentication and TLS connections are disabled, but fails when Redis authentication and TLS connections are enabled.EVALSHA fails with the following error:Steps to reproduce or test case.Create AWS ElastiCache Redis Cluster 5.0.6 and enable authentication and TLS connections.Use Redisson redisson-spring-boot-starter 3.16.3 with Spring RedisTemplate to run a Lua script operation against that cluster, which will end up calling EVALSHA operation on Redisson client.Thank you!

Redis keep the keys even if they are expired.Hi !I'm using Redisson 3.16.1 with a RMapCache with a MaxIdleTime, a TTL and a MaxSize in LRU mode.The key of the cached value in the map contains a date so it won't be called the next day.I was expecting for those keys to disapear after the TTL has expired but it doesn't seems to work this way. I can reduce the number of keys per cache but that's quite weird.My understanding is that the framework wait for the key to be called to clean up.Notice that I have activated  :useScriptCache: true.cleanUpKeysAmount: 1000.Thank you for your help.
Is RBatch a single get/put call to Redis server using MGET/MSET functionality ·.RBuckets uses MSET/MGET functionality but RBuckets.set() doesn't have an option to set TTL for entries.From documentation of RBatch, it was mentioned: RBatch requests are batched to separate queue and could be executed later with execute(). Does this mean each request in batch gets executed at once or is MSET/MGET functionality used to execute all requests of batch at once?@mrniko Can you please confirm if results of batch.execute() is in order and if value is not present in cache for get request, does it return null?
none.
RBloomFilter batch and async mode.Hi,I faced a problem similar to one mentioned in #3094 but for the contains method. When I want to test a large number of elements it's more sensible to test a group of objects in the same call.I implemented batch method Map<T, Boolean> contains(Collection<T> objects) and immediately decided that if we want to make it performant RFuture should be used.And here comes my question: if I wanted to create PR for those changes, should aync version (RFuture<Map<T, Boolean>> containsAsync(Collection<T> objects)) be implemented in RBloomFilter or should I create RBloomFilterAsync as it seems to be a convention used for other classes? The second option is more tedious as RBloomFilter hasn't extended RBloomFilterAsync so far for some reason.

AWS Elasticache Redis Replicated server and master failover.Hi,we use the latest version of redisson and a 3 node AWS Redis (one master, 2 replica).The config yaml list all three node as replicated server.During a service update deployment, AWS update the 3 nodes, doing a failover of the master to an updated replica to update the last node.Our application has logged a few errors -READONLY You can't write against a read only replica.for around 500ms.Is there an automatic system in redisson that will try to revalidate where is the master node in case of READONLY error ?does those 500ms between the moment AWS swith the old master to a read replica and promote a new master ?or is it the leftover of the scaninterval use by the connection manager to check for new master ?Any way to avoid or react (retry) easily on those errors ?(this error popup in code using cachemanager, but we also use RBucket)Thanks.

Unable to change master after the Redis singleServer changes Ip address.Hi, we are using singleServerConfig to connect to Redis server hosted in Cloud. we are using Redisson client 3.16.0 and pointing to elastic cache Reader endpoint and Redis server is running with one master one read replica. After the Redis server changes the IP address, DnsMonitor detected the IP address change correctly but is not able to connect again and throwing error.
Is it possible to have batch/bulk getWithTTLOnly and getWithTTLOnlyAsync methods in RMapCache?Hi! We are using RMapCache object to store key-value pair with TTL per key in an AWS ElactiCache cluster mode enabled setup. In this setup, we have multiple shards and at least one replica per shard and we want the application reads to strictly be from the replica nodes for performance reasons. We were earlier using RMapCache.getAllAsync method and realized that, as explained in #2165, this method will always read from the primary node. Upon further reading, we came across #2981, which mentions the RMapCache.getWithTTLOnly method that can serve the reads from replica nodes.In our use case, we will be reading multiple keys from the RMapCache all at once. In the case when the values for these keys are not present in RMapCache object, we will be making one network call for each missing key to Redis. Hence we wanted to understand if it would be possible to have bulk/batch variants of these methods, similar to other getAll and getAllAsync?Happy to share more details.

REntity.TransformationMode.IMPLEMENTATION_BASED is not working using Live Object Service.Expected behavior.I annotate my object with @rentity(fieldTransformation = REntity.TransformationMode.IMPLEMENTATION_BASED) to make sure that my map is not converted to RedissonMap. According to documentation at Section 9.2.5. Annotations.fieldTransformation - You can also specify a field transformation mode for the RLO. As mentioned before, in order to keep everything as close to standard Java as possible, Redisson will automatically transform fields with commonly-used Java util classes to Redisson compatible classes. This uses ANNOTATION_BASED as the default value. You can set it to IMPLEMENTATION_BASED which will skip the transformation.I expect that my map will be always stay as HashMap or at least as a normal JVM map instance.Actual behavior.When I read back the object using attach, object returns map as an instance of RedissionMap.Steps to reproduce or test case.

Why is Redisson not writing data to some shards in AWS ElactiCache (cluster mode enabled)? 16 ·.Hi! I am using Redisson 3.16.3 with AWS ElastiCache in cluster mode enabled.AWS ElastiCache Setup:Stage#1: Redis in cluster mode enabled, with 2 shards and each shard having 1 primary and 2 replica nodes.Stage#2: After some time, I added 2 more shards to this cluster, thus it has a total of 4 shards (4 primaries + 8 replicas).Stage#3: Eventually, I removed one cluster, thus the final setup is 3 shards (3 primaries + 6 replicas).I have used this application code to put various keys into Redis in all the three stages on my AWS ElastiCache setup. While transitioning between each stage, I can see Redisson has identified the shard addition/removal and the ClusterConnectionManager is logging slot movements (... slots added to ..., ... slots removed from ...). I can also see that all the shards in all the stages have active connections with my application based on the "Current Connections" AWS graph of each shard.Problem/Issue Faced:But in all 3 stages, some shards are never receiving any data at all. And I believe these shards should be receiving the data because my slot partitioning logline is printing the key's slot to be on these no-data-receiving shards.Is it possible that I am logging the slot partitioning incorrectly here, and Redisson is appending some metadata to $myRedisKey before inserting it into Redis? Or have I misconfigured something in this entire setup?Please find attached some logs and graphs supporting that data for a key that should be going to shard#3 in stage#2 when there are 4 shards in total, but there are no items at all on shard#3.Happy to share more details.

FstCodec.FstCodec.Why did YOU rewrite the map.Is there a problem.
Strange mess with data being read from different keys causing mysterious ClassCastExceptions until application is restarted.Expected behavior.Values read from different keys concurrently should be returned to a proper calling thread. I.e. RedissonClient.getBucket("Key_1", new FstCodec()).get() should return value stored under key "Key_1".Actual behavior.We get sometimes very strange situtations causing the whole process to mix up all values from different caches, causing ClassCastException(s) or deserialization exceptions with values from different types of keys trying to be deserialized or cast to types used by completely different redis keys.Probably it happens after a small networking problem in production when there are some timeouts or slow server responses.Here is an excerpt from our production logs from a single application instance:It looks like it has read Long value from a key that is used for RedissonLock objects instead of com.xxx.customers.CustomerInfo at 01/11/2021, 09:10:16.421, and then later at 01/11/2021, 09:10:18.120 tried to cast String read from com.xxx.customers.CustomerInfo key (which is actually a FstCodec encoded binary object) cast to Long used by RedissonLock.And if such thing happens, then we continue getting such strange errors for other keys/locks until we restart the JVM.Steps to reproduce or test case.Don't know, it happens too randomly and not so frequently, but if it happens, it causes random errors in production causing problems to our customers.
Redisson client should be created even without all connections being initialized.The problem we are facing now with Redisson is that we create the Redisson client at the application start-up and quite often we get an error like the following:Unable to init enough connections amount! Only 49 of 50 were initialized.or for a different use case:Unable to init enough connections amount! Only 1 of 2 were initialized.This leads to the client not being created.We don't want to retry synchronously because it would slow down the application start-up which in turn would slow down the AutoScalingGroup outscaling.We would like to get an instance of the Redisson client even if none of the connections are initialized. There should be some async retry mechanism for re-establishing the connections.We currently use a Dummy client as a fallback (when the Redis is not critical)) or manage the client creation async retry by ourselves, but we need to replicate this retry mechanism for each Redisson client (we have different use cases with different Redis clusters).Would be very useful to have such a functionality built-in. We used to have Aerospike before Redis and Aerospike had such a functionality (you were able to set this property to false)

Redis Sentinel doesn't add resurrected master back into node cluster  unless one of the sentinel is restarted externally in Redisson setup.Explored and Tried lot of ways to automate redis sentinel process of auto discovering failed/resurrected master node in Master Slave Setup.  Tried this setup in containerized environment, unless I manually restart one of the sentinels the old master node will be discovered by the sentinels and would be converted as slave in the new master.Need immediate help for this issue.Sample Snippet of Redisson Sentinel Setup.Please let me know what I'm missing in the setup and provide workaround at the earliest.Thanks.Varun.
Issue with adding resurrected master as slave after master is restarted back from failover.Expected behavior.Redis Sentinel should auto reconfigure the resurrected master from failover and be placed as slave under new master. This setup is working only when I manually restart one of the sentinel node.Actual behavior.Resurrected master from failover is not added back into master slave setup and becomes an independent node unless one of the sentinel node is restarted and old master becomes a slave to the new master.Steps to reproduce or test case.Setup a RedissonClient with Sentinel setup.
Significant performance drop and loss of scalability after Redisson client upgrade.Hello,There is a significant performance drop and loss of scalability after upgrading Redisson client from 2.2.12 to 3.10.6.The performance (throughput - number of requests per second) dropped by almost 40% and the scalability of the Spring-boot app using it was lost, meaning that adding more instances of the Spring-boot app doesn't increase the system's throughput.Some technical details:Redis 3.0.7 64 bit in cluster mode - 3 masters and 3 slaves.Please find attached redisson.json file redisson-3.10.6.json.txt.The reason why the client was originally upgraded was because of the following error that appeared in the log:With the previous client version the performance was excellent and the solution was scalable.Please advise.Regards,Nethanel.

Redisson connection uses unsafe.Allocatememory() cause direct memory leak.Hey,In the production environment, we found that the memory occupied by the program has been increasing. Using the top command, we found that the value of RES has been increasing, even exceeding Xmx. We use jconsole.exe to observe that the number of threads and classes is stable, and the size of heap memory and meta space are within the normal range. Therefore, we begin to suspect that the program is constantly occupying native memory and is not released.When we use gperftools to analyze the memory allocation occupied by the program, we will find that the method unsafe.Allocatememory0 occupies a very large proportion of memory and increases over time.This is the original PDF file generated using gperftools analyzer memory.After debugging with debug, it is found that the thread redisson-netty calls unsafe.Allocatememory().After modifying the redisson configuration so that redisson is no longer used to connect to redis, we use gperftools to observe that there is no Unsafe_AllocateMemory0, and the memory occupied by the program remains stable and will not increase,so we now suspect that redisson caused the program's native memory leak.Expected behavior.We hope to get your help so that we can use redisson without increasing the memory all the time.My environment.

Redisson Client AWS Elastic Cache Configuration Best Practice.I want to configure Redisson Client to connect it to AWS ElasticCache. There is not much documentation that what's the best practice to do so.AWS ElasticCache provides Primary Endpoint and Reader Endpoint for writes and reads respectively.Now instead of mentioning each nodes endpoint I would prefer to use Primary Endpoint and Reader Endpoint.But from what I saw in multiple github issues in this repo, it was advises to use node endpoints directly. Why was that ? Reader Endpoint helps me to add more servers to Redis without changing the code base. Will Redisson pick up more servers automatically ?Thanks.

Distributed iterator.Hello.We have a huge sorted set (1m+ elements), that should be processed in parallel by different application instances. We came up to the idea to have a LUA script that will call a ZSCAN command using a saved cursor to return each element to app only once. Due to single-threaded nature of Redis engine, it would make a iterator, shared across all clients.I didn't find anything like it in Redisson. If you think that this feature would be useful, I can prepare a PR in a week. If not - sorry for disturbance.
How can i configure TypedJsonJacksonCodec from yaml file ?No description provided.
Connection configuration for a replicaset behind anycasted address:Hi!First of all, thanks for an amazing library!I'm looking for advice here on the client configuration for the following setup:Redis 4 instance consists of:1 master.2 slaves.sentinels.All servers are, so to say, ephemeral, and hence in front of the instances, there is haproxy server + bird2 that together achieve anycast advertisement of a fixed IP address and proxy traffic to the current master. Users are instructed to connect to master only and given the DNS entry for the anycast IP. Slaves are not in use and are only there to pick up the role of master in the event of the failover. Setup is similar to what is described in haproxy blog.As a result, for Redission client I have only a single host:ip endpoint to use in configuration. I tried configuring Redission with both:It seems neither of these two appear to be able to detect a failover event. When failover happens and a new master is elected, Redission keeps using existing established connections trying to write to what now became a slave, and getting:READONLY You can't write against a read-only slave.My question is: isn't useReplicatedServers() supposed to periodically check the actual ROLE of a server it is connected to, so that when such a "silent" change in topology happens behind haproxy? Could it be that it is a problem on haproxy side, that keeps proxying traffic through open connections to previously connected node? I'd expect exactly a periodic ROLE check to address this.Thank you.

Returning Null Value  from  redissonClient.getMapCache(CLIENT_MAP).get(key)  in replicated  multinode cluster.Hello,I am trying to fetch  a value for a particular key from a replicated  multinode cluster.  This cluster has 2 nodes. Node1, Node2 with authentication on. I am inserting values and trying to fetch the same value.Key-value pair insertion happened in node1. And while fetching the same key-value pair , I am suspecting it it trying to get it from node2.Please find my code below.From redis cli I had to do readonly on node2 inorder to c the keys. If readonly is only option to fetch the key-value pair from java code, how to code it?Help is appreciated . Thank you in advance.

Cannot inject dependencies into runnable scheduled task.Hi, I am having trouble injecting beans into scheduled tasks. I am able to connect with redis to do other things so I don't believe it is a configuration issue.  ​I saw someone else had posted a similar issue but it seems like it got closed without being resolved: #2318.Essentially, I am trying to schedule a tasks on a distributed server to send a reminder to a user after x amount of time. In order to do this, I need to inject a bean to be able to get the current state of the user at the time the task is executed and another bean to be able to send the notification. However, I am running into the same Null Pointer and Not Serializable exceptions as from the issue above.I have also tried another approach where I register the task to a RRemoteService so when it tries to execute, it will call a server-side RRemoteService that has the dependencies autowired. However, when I do that, it gives an IllegalArgumentException: Unable to serialize lambda.I'm pretty stuck on what to do and I was wondering if someone could help provide guidance on if this would even be possible with Redisson or if I should try to find another solution? It would be helpful if someone could provide an example of an @Autowired service being injected into a task and it working.

I want save lock state with redis instance failover. What configuration for lock and redis can do this?Hello, i search distributed lock, that if one redis instance crash all setted locks can be transfered and accessed from other redis instances.I think this situation is solved only by redlock or multilock with 3 redis master nodes but not cluster ?In documentation:8.4. RedLock.This object is deprecated. RLock operations now propagated to all Redis slaves.Is a blocking redundancy scheme possible with master-slave replication(sentinel, not cluster) ?
Local cache not working as expected when executing multiple put and get operations on the same key.Expected behavior.We found an unexpected behavior using the Redisson local cache in our application.This application is loading a redis map constantly using Redisson local cache, executing put and get operations.The get operation returns the expected value almost all the time, but sometimes we found that it does not return the expected value. The expected value is what the application just put before the get operation.This is something that only happens when we use a LocalCachedMap. If we switch to a Map then it works as expected. Anyway, we need to use a LocalCachedMap in this application.In short: we expect to execute a put operation, then a get operation with the same key and receive the value that we just put before.Actual behavior.Sometimes we execute a put operation on a "localCachedMap", then a get operation with the same key and receive a different value than what we just put before.Steps to reproduce or test case.A test to reproduce the issue:It fails on different iterations when you execute the test more than once:We tried to remove the line 292 from RedissonLocalCachedMap.getAsync() and the test just works:But we don't know why it reaches that line because the getAsync() method should end on line 262 when it finds the value on the local cache (the value should be on the local cache because we execute a put before the get):

 org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException: SlaveConnectionPool no available Redis entries.Specification we are using:AWS Elasticache- Redis 5.0.6 (Cluster Mode with master and slave)We are intermittently facing the below error. I think this is because the Master instance is loosing connection to the slave instance.If we check the elasticache, all instance in the cluster are in available status.Only way to resolve is to redeploy the application.Any idea on configuration that should be tweaked? Or does redisson provides any time interval to refresh the connection to avoid this?I checked the other post but looks it is closed but doesn't have an answer to the question.

RLock syncedSlaves in BatchResult is not checked.I tried RLock(Redisson master branch, redis 5.0.5) with the following config and tried to test whether synchronous replication works with master-slave. After I killed one replica and the lock can still be granted(there was only one client trying to get the lock), what I expect is that the client failed to acquired the lock cause the command was not able to propagate to all the replicas.After debug for a while, I found that BatchResult for EVAL & WAIT command was not checked in RedissonBaseLock.evalWriteAsync method,  i.e the syncedSlaves in BatchResult was not checked.So is it because i misunderstand the synchronous replication mechanism used in Redisson or it's a bug.

Redisson executor: service rolling upgrade compatibility.Consider the following scenario in a service HA cluster:service 1 node 1 is at version 1, with task-legacy-1.service 1 node 2 is upgraded to version 2, with task-legacy-1, task-new-1.service 1 node 2 submits task-new-1 to Redisson executor.There's a chance that service 1 node 1 picks up the submitted task-new-1, but will fail due to lack of definition.I think this issue is common for all services that using Redisson executor. What's the best practice?Thinking of potential solutions:Normally with distributed scheduler, there's a tag filter, to filter worker nodes for task. But can't find similar thing in Redisson. ------ please advise.Another idea is to use different executor namespaces, and each service version N submits tasks to executor-N (the latest) and executes task from both executor-N-1 and executor N.  However this is also hard for upgrade and eviction of old executor is needed. Seems a blocker when there's recurring schedule submitted in old executor. Not sure how to migrate.  ----- please advise.

Allow specifying class instance each time when deserializing.Currently, if you deserialize an object it will always be created using the same class instance as when it was serialized. This will result in a ClassCastException if you serialize and deserialize from classes loaded by different class loaders (which is a case when using something like hot code reload).The proposed solution is to add a type parameter in every method that deserializes an object, e.g.MyClass value = rMap.get("key", MyClass.class);Which is the same as in a popular GSON library.

Why list has all value, but redisson get one by index from the list will reconnect Redis?1、List has all values, but when get by index redisson will reconnect redis.2、Isn't it dangerous to get all the data of the list in memory?

RedissonMap keySet() is inefficient.This feature request is partially driven by a problem we are having and our attempts to fix it.We have multiple services and are utilizing LocalCachedMap's for various write once read many use-cases. The problem arises when a different service needs to invalidate keys in those LocalCachedMap's without the required keys in the class path. We started out with this looking like.localCacheMap.fastRemove(localCacheMap.keySet("pattern*").toArray(String[]::new));But were getting ClassNotFoundException as Redisson is executing an HSCAN which is returning both the Key and Value and these were being run through the Codec leading to this error.Currently our workaround is to use a custom codec that just discards the value to avoid this issue.The only reason I call this a workaround and not a solution is because the values we have in the map are vary large when compared to the keys, so there is an overhead to moving those all over the network that would be great to be able to avoid.Currently it looks like in RedissonMap the keyIterator(...) will use a RedissonMapIterator and just grab the key and do nothing with the value.It may be possible to use a Lua script such as the one found here  to only actually return the keys from the HSCAN call and prevent the overhead of moving them over the network and unmashalling them.A new iterator RedissonMapKeyIterator could be implemented for this specific use case.

RMapCache size() method is inconsistent with keySet()/values()/entrySet() methods.Expected behavior.size() method should return the same value as count of items in collections returned from keySet()/values()/entrySet() methods.It is needed to safely convert RMapCache to other collections. Typical conversion involves 2 steps: retrieve size(); then based on that value do further conversions. Some implementations could use iterator().next() right after checking that size() > 0, it is expected to be safe.Actual behavior.size() method does not take expired items in mind, but keySet()/values()/entrySet() methods return not expired items only. It gives count inconsistency. Implementations using iterator().next() right after checking that size() > 0 will fail with java.util.NoSuchElementException.Steps to reproduce or test case.Unit tests in Kotlin illustrates the problem:
org.redisson.client.RedisException: ERR unknown command 'WAIT'.When I use Redisson of V3.14.1 and advanced version, it occur a error such as code below.

Add configuration to MasterSlaveServersConfig to manually set syncSlaves.Hello,I'm using a MasterSlaveServersConfig with readMode="SLAVE" and Redis Enterprise. While this configuration works with Redis OSS, it is not always applicable to Redis Enterprise since read-replicas are scaled-out at the database-level; not shard.Redis Enterprise can guarantee HA with a single replica shard however the throughput requires multiple read-replicas. This mismatch between the total slaveAddresses registered in the configuration and total shards used for HA causes a timeout in the WAIT command issued by Redisson Transactions.I checked Redisson’s code and found that the MasterSlaveServersConfig is passed to the MasterSlaveEntry which is used by BatchOptions to set syncSlaves based on the amount of slaveAddresses configured. When a Redisson Transaction is executed, the amount of syncSlaves determines how many HA replica shards are needed to respond before the WAIT command releases its lock. With the mismatch, this means that they will always timeout.As a workaround, I'm using a single slaveAddress in MasterSlaveServersConfig which points to a reverse-proxy for load-balancing of reads between two separate Redis Enterprise database endpoints. Those databases are kept in-synch using Redis Enterprise's replica-of and it worked. However, this is not an optimal solution since it adds an extra network-hop and deployment complexity.So, my feature request is to add a new optional field in the MasterSlaveServersConfig to set syncSlaves manually which will allow users to pass multiple slaveAddresses without impacting the use of the WAIT command on the master database/shard. Since the freeze logic is run in other connection related methods, there would still be protection to handle unavailable read-replicas.Thanks, Allen.

spring boot application with redisson for spring cache usig aws elasticache redis.Our redis nodes seems to use lots of cpu, how can we find more information about why that much cpu?And what sort of redisson configuration we can do to help that ?Having bigger instances in AWS would not sove it as redis is still limited to one cpu core.we use redisson for caching with spring boot cache. One cache is caching 'big' data  (heavy structure for pagination), another one has more smaller entries but lots of potential cache check/write.What sort of metrics we can get from redisson to get a better understanding of the cpu use in redis ?

How the increase of the memory/key usage cause the Redis timeout exception ?Hi community,I am using a 3-master and 3-slave redis cluster. The redisson client version is 3.15.1.Previously the memory usages is approx. 20G, and the total keys are approx. 20million. And I didn't encounter a single exception.Recently the memory usage is increased to 40G, and the total keys are around 40million. Now I start to get following exceptions randomly.For example:and.There are other exceptions relate to other redis command, but the common part is "Unable to acquire connection! Avoid to use blocking commands in Async/JavaRx/Reactive handlers. Try to increase connection pool size".The code is same, the only difference that I can see is the increase memory & key usage. Could this be the culprit which causing these issues? And why?Thanks ahead for your time!

Exception when two modules use different Redisson version (3.16.1 and 3.16.8) ·58 ·.Hi,I have 2 module A and B, using same Redisson 3.16.1. The modules are using a RLocalCachedMap. I want to change Redisson version of B server to 3.16.8. And I'm facing with exception.I know that LocalCachedMessageCodec encode and decode methods were changed for a reason. And this exception is thrown when LocalCachedMap updated.I wonder that does it have any way to run server A and B with different Redisson version?P/s: That is my example.

Is Rbatch excute operation atomic?I have keys in array of ByteArray (ByteArray for each key) and I am wondering if redisson enable returning value/timeout/null(miss) for different key with batch execute.

TOML Config Support.Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.My application uses TOML for its configurations and it would be nice if the Redisson configs were TOML too. TOML is an INI-like human-readable config language that's increasing in popularity.Here's some references on TOML:Describe the solution you'd like.TOML support should be added to Redisson Config using Jackson.Redisson Config seems to use Jackson to handle JSON and YAML. As of Jackson 2.13, jackson-dataformats-text supports TOML in addition to YAML. It seems that Redisson upgraded to Jackson 2.13 with commit 3f457c9 on Dec 21, 2021.By adding the TOML backend, jackson-dataformats-toml, the TomlFactory type can be used similar to how the YAMLFactory type is used in org.redisson.config.ConfigSupport.Describe alternatives you've considered.Current workaround is to not use TOML and have Redisson's configs stored in YAML. Resulting in my application requiring multiple config formats.

We repeated the test using both redis-benchmark tool & Redisson ( Client we use for production).With redisson as soon as MemoryUtilisation reached 100% we observed a sudden spike in CPU , accompanied with WriteRedisConnectionException . This CPU spike lead to node failures again and again. We didnt observe the same behaviour with redis-benchmark tool.My question is : Why would there be a spike in CPU with Redisson ? How can we avoid this & is there an ability to perform exponential backoff timeout in redisson?Redisson Error Message when memory reaches 100%  : Error message: org.redisson.client.WriteRedisConnectionException: Unable to write command into connection! Increase connection pool size).IMO, the timeouts are already quite high. I dont see new connections being formed as well.
See the following error intermittently when trying to initialize the redisson client during the start of our Spring Application : "Unable to decode data. channel"" ·.Redisson version :We have the following RMapCache beans that will basically create the RMapCache for us :Stacktrace :Expected :For our spring application to start without any issues. The application fails to start because the redisson client cannot be initialized. This error is intermittent and difficult to reproduce all the time.
issue with RedissonLocalCachedMap#removeAsync with LOCALCACHE_REDIS store mode.Expected behavior.When I remove values, using RedissonLocalCachedMap#removeAsync method, expectation is that values are removed i.e. no longer retrievable from cache.Actual behavior.Does not seem to be the case. "Removed" values are retrievable via "getAsync" operation.Steps to reproduce or test case.Here's the reproducible test project:Steps to reproduce:clone the project.in the system-out element body, we observe the following:i.e. all values with even "attribute" are removed from the cache.However, the test fails with:
Reisson delay queue execution throw "ERROR org.redisson.QueueTransferTask -Unable to acquire connection!".In the process of using reisson, when reisson delay queue is normally used, it will be thrown during operation.I confirm that the redis service is normal because there is no problem with another redisson delay queue. Normal after service restart.What are the possible causes of this problem? Is it because the connection is suddenly unavailable?I need your help.
