 #1 Error in Build

Hi,
When i try to execute the script build (build the jar
archive) i can't because the javac give me the
following error :
I can't find the class org.hsql.Map (used in class
jdbcconnect)
My version of JVM is 1.1.8
Please send me the correct source
Best Regards
Joao Luis

 #2 Please Support multiple ResultSets!

Currently, the jdbcStatement class does NOT support
multiple ResultSets. (This is clearly documented in
the javadocs, and is also obvious from looking at the
source code.)
However, this makes this class USELESS for executing
general stored procedures (which OFTEN do mutiple
queries -- doing complex stuff like this is usually
the whole point behind using stored procedures).

 #3 bug in the getMoreResults() method

The getMoreResults() method of org.hsql.jdbcStatement
class fails to follow the Statement interface specs
exactly. This causes problems with code that should
work.
The basic problem is that getMoreResults() fails to
advance the current ResultSet. (It also fails to close
the current ResultSet, which is also a violation of
the spec.)
Since HypersonicSQL currently does not support
multiple ResultSets, what SHOULD happen if the specs
are to be exactly followed is that the next ResultSet
should be advanced to null after closing the initial
one when getMoreResults() is called.
Below is the current (and buggy) implementation of
getMoreResults():

To illustrate the current bug, and also to test that
the above patch actually solves the probelm, consider
the following code which works with any properly
written JDBC Statement implementation (but fails in
HypersonicSQL):
From the Javadoc on Statment:
The above code fails with updates (but not queries)
because the loop never ends. This happens because
fails to return -1 the second time that it is called.
If the above patch to getMoreResults()
were in place, then getUpdateCount() WOULD recognize
that the current RS is null and then would return -1.

 #4 DatabaseMetaData.getExportedKeys broken

I am writting a java program that analizes the
relations among the different tables in the database.
When I create a table using FOREIGN KEY, Hypersonic
classes don't write to the SYSTEM_EXPORTEDKEYS table.
Then, when I call to the getExportedKeys method, I
obtain no data.
Thanks.

 #6 LONGVARBINARY error using setObject

using hsql version 1.42
When using setObject to set the value of a binary
column a class cast error occurs.
I have made the following changes that solved the
problem:

 #7 Fix for &amp;amp;quot;SELECT x, SUM(y)&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;amp; &amp;amp;quot;GROUP BY x

The following sql does not work correctly:
It returns a single null row.
The bug is in Select.java, getResults() method

 #8 Fix for &amp;amp;quot;SELECT x, SUM(y)&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;amp; &amp;amp;quot;GROUP BY x

The following sql does not work correctly:
It returns a single null row.
The bug is in Select.java, getResults() method

 #9 Code transition and standards

On 2001-04-04 nobody@nowhere screamed in frustrationa
and said:
I'd like to supply some fixes we made to HSQL over
the time. However, we need to be able to reconcile
those changes with whatever you did to HSQL.
This is _impossible_ to do, since all files changed
due to your formatting changes. There's no way to find
out what changed between 1.43 and 1.60RC2.
Do you have any kind of change history documenting the
changes you made?
I can't even just grab the newest sources - I added
some testing framework to HSQL that I'd hate to lose.
Is there any way to merge stuff back?
This is an ongoing issue and will be cross-posted as
an open bug as we transition our customers to the new
code base.
For the future of this project, NOTHING IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THIS! At least until we get the CVS
tree in place. Mark has offered to do this on an
individual basis but we need two things from the
developers:
a) someone to volunteer to be trained by Mark to do
this for customers/users (could be - SHOULD BE -
multiple someones (ideally 3))
b) someone to ride herd on this in the future (again,
should be more than one) and assist me in this
specifically, keeping me aware and honest - THIS KIND
